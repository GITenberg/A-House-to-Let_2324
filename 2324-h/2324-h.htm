<h2>OVER THE WAY</h2>
<p>I had been living at Tunbridge Wells and nowhere else, going on for
ten years, when my medical man&mdash;very clever in his profession,
and the prettiest player I ever saw in my life of a hand at Long Whist,
which was a noble and a princely game before Short was heard of&mdash;said
to me, one day, as he sat feeling my pulse on the actual sofa which
my poor dear sister Jane worked before her spine came on, and laid her
on a board for fifteen months at a stretch&mdash;the most upright woman
that ever lived&mdash;said to me, &ldquo;What we want, ma&rsquo;am,
is a fillip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, goodness gracious, Doctor Towers!&rdquo; says
I, quite startled at the man, for he was so christened himself: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
talk as if you were alluding to people&rsquo;s names; but say what you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, my dear ma&rsquo;am, that we want a little change
of air and scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the man!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;does he mean we or me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Lard forgive you, Doctor Towers,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;why
don&rsquo;t you get into a habit of expressing yourself in a straightforward
manner, like a loyal subject of our gracious Queen Victoria, and a member
of the Church of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towers laughed, as he generally does when he has fidgetted me into
any of my impatient ways&mdash;one of my states, as I call them&mdash;and
then he began,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tone, ma&rsquo;am, Tone, is all you require!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He appealed to Trottle, who just then came in with the coal-scuttle,
looking, in his nice black suit, like an amiable man putting on coals
from motives of benevolence.</p>
<p>Trottle (whom I always call my right hand) has been in my service
two-and-thirty years.&nbsp; He entered my service, far away from England.&nbsp;
He is the best of creatures, and the most respectable of men; but, opinionated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says Trottle, making up
the fire in his quiet and skilful way, &ldquo;is Tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard forgive you both!&rdquo; says I, bursting out a-laughing;
&ldquo;I see you are in a conspiracy against me, so I suppose you must
do what you like with me, and take me to London for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some weeks Towers had hinted at London, and consequently I was
prepared for him.&nbsp; When we had got to this point, we got on so
expeditiously, that Trottle was packed off to London next day but one,
to find some sort of place for me to lay my troublesome old head in.</p>
<p>Trottle came back to me at the Wells after two days&rsquo; absence,
with accounts of a charming place that could be taken for six months
certain, with liberty to renew on the same terms for another six, and
which really did afford every accommodation that I wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you really find no fault at all in the rooms, Trottle?&rdquo;
I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single one, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; They are exactly suitable
to you.&nbsp; There is not a fault in them.&nbsp; There is but one fault
outside of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are opposite a House to Let.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; I said, considering of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;But is that
such a very great objection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it my duty to mention it, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; It is
a dull object to look at.&nbsp; Otherwise, I was so greatly pleased
with the lodging that I should have closed with the terms at once, as
I had your authority to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trottle thinking so highly of the place, in my interest, I wished
not to disappoint him.&nbsp; Consequently I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The empty House may let, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, dear no, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Trottle, shaking his
head with decision; &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t let.&nbsp; It never does let,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy me!&nbsp; Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; All I have to mention is,
ma&rsquo;am, that the House won&rsquo;t let!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has this unfortunate House been to let, in the name
of Fortune?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever so long,&rdquo; said Trottle.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it in ruins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal out of repair, ma&rsquo;am, but it&rsquo;s
not in ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long and the short of this business was, that next day I had
a pair of post-horses put to my chariot&mdash;for, I never travel by
railway: not that I have anything to say against railways, except that
they came in when I was too old to take to them; and that they made
ducks and drakes of a few turnpike-bonds I had&mdash;and so I went up
myself, with Trottle in the rumble, to look at the inside of this same
lodging, and at the outside of this same House.</p>
<p>As I say, I went and saw for myself.&nbsp; The lodging was perfect.&nbsp;
That, I was sure it would be; because Trottle is the best judge of comfort
I know.&nbsp; The empty house was an eyesore; and that I was sure it
would be too, for the same reason.&nbsp; However, setting the one thing
against the other, the good against the bad, the lodging very soon got
the victory over the House.&nbsp; My lawyer, Mr. Squares, of Crown Office
Row; Temple, drew up an agreement; which his young man jabbered over
so dreadfully when he read it to me, that I didn&rsquo;t understand
one word of it except my own name; and hardly that, and I signed it,
and the other party signed it, and, in three weeks&rsquo; time, I moved
my old bones, bag and baggage, up to London.</p>
<p>For the first month or so, I arranged to leave Trottle at the Wells.&nbsp;
I made this arrangement, not only because there was a good deal to take
care of in the way of my school-children and pensioners, and also of
a new stove in the hall to air the house in my absence, which appeared
to me calculated to blow up and burst; but, likewise because I suspect
Trottle (though the steadiest of men, and a widower between sixty and
seventy) to be what I call rather a Philanderer.&nbsp; I mean, that
when any friend comes down to see me and brings a maid, Trottle is always
remarkably ready to show that maid the Wells of an evening; and that
I have more than once noticed the shadow of his arm, outside the room
door nearly opposite my chair, encircling that maid&rsquo;s waist on
the landing, like a table-cloth brush.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought it just as well, before any London Philandering
took place, that I should have a little time to look round me, and to
see what girls were in and about the place.&nbsp; So, nobody stayed
with me in my new lodging at first after Trottle had established me
there safe and sound, but Peggy Flobbins, my maid; a most affectionate
and attached woman, who never was an object of Philandering since I
have known her, and is not likely to begin to become so after nine-and-twenty
years next March.</p>
<p>It was the fifth of November when I first breakfasted in my new rooms.&nbsp;
The Guys were going about in the brown fog, like magnified monsters
of insects in table-beer, and there was a Guy resting on the door-steps
of the House to Let.&nbsp; I put on my glasses, partly to see how the
boys were pleased with what I sent them out by Peggy, and partly to
make sure that she didn&rsquo;t approach too near the ridiculous object,
which of course was full of sky-rockets, and might go off into bangs
at any moment.&nbsp; In this way it happened that the first time I ever
looked at the House to Let, after I became its opposite neighbour, I
had my glasses on.&nbsp; And this might not have happened once in fifty
times, for my sight is uncommonly good for my time of life; and I wear
glasses as little as I can, for fear of spoiling it.</p>
<p>I knew already that it was a ten-roomed house, very dirty, and much
dilapidated; that the area-rails were rusty and peeling away, and that
two or three of them were wanting, or half-wanting; that there were
broken panes of glass in the windows, and blotches of mud on other panes,
which the boys had thrown at them; that there was quite a collection
of stones in the area, also proceeding from those Young Mischiefs; that
there were games chalked on the pavement before the house, and likenesses
of ghosts chalked on the street-door; that the windows were all darkened
by rotting old blinds, or shutters, or both; that the bills &ldquo;To
Let,&rdquo; had curled up, as if the damp air of the place had given
them cramps; or had dropped down into corners, as if they were no more.&nbsp;
I had seen all this on my first visit, and I had remarked to Trottle,
that the lower part of the black board about terms was split away; that
the rest had become illegible, and that the very stone of the door-steps
was broken across.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, I sat at my breakfast table
on that Please to Remember the fifth of November morning, staring at
the House through my glasses, as if I had never looked at it before.</p>
<p>All at once&mdash;in the first-floor window on my right&mdash;down
in a low corner, at a hole in a blind or a shutter&mdash;I found that
I was looking at a secret Eye.&nbsp; The reflection of my fire may have
touched it and made it shine; but, I saw it shine and vanish.</p>
<p>The eye might have seen me, or it might not have seen me, sitting
there in the glow of my fire&mdash;you can take which probability you
prefer, without offence&mdash;but something struck through my frame,
as if the sparkle of this eye had been electric, and had flashed straight
at me.&nbsp; It had such an effect upon me, that I could not remain
by myself, and I rang for Flobbins, and invented some little jobs for
her, to keep her in the room.&nbsp; After my breakfast was cleared away,
I sat in the same place with my glasses on, moving my head, now so,
and now so, trying whether, with the shining of my fire and the flaws
in the window-glass, I could reproduce any sparkle seeming to be up
there, that was like the sparkle of an eye.&nbsp; But no; I could make
nothing like it.&nbsp; I could make ripples and crooked lines in the
front of the House to Let, and I could even twist one window up and
loop it into another; but, I could make no eye, nor anything like an
eye.&nbsp; So I convinced myself that I really had seen an eye.</p>
<p>Well, to be sure I could not get rid of the impression of this eye,
and it troubled me and troubled me, until it was almost a torment.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t think I was previously inclined to concern my head much
about the opposite House; but, after this eye, my head was full of the
house; and I thought of little else than the house, and I watched the
house, and I talked about the house, and I dreamed of the house.&nbsp;
In all this, I fully believe now, there was a good Providence.&nbsp;
But, you will judge for yourself about that, bye-and-bye.</p>
<p>My landlord was a butler, who had married a cook, and set up housekeeping.&nbsp;
They had not kept house longer than a couple of years, and they knew
no more about the House to Let than I did.&nbsp; Neither could I find
out anything concerning it among the trades-people or otherwise; further
than what Trottle had told me at first.&nbsp; It had been empty, some
said six years, some said eight, some said ten.&nbsp; It never did let,
they all agreed, and it never would let.</p>
<p>I soon felt convinced that I should work myself into one of my states
about the House; and I soon did.&nbsp; I lived for a whole month in
a flurry, that was always getting worse.&nbsp; Towers&rsquo;s prescriptions,
which I had brought to London with me, were of no more use than nothing.&nbsp;
In the cold winter sunlight, in the thick winter fog, in the black winter
rain, in the white winter snow, the House was equally on my mind.&nbsp;
I have heard, as everybody else has, of a spirit&rsquo;s haunting a
house; but I have had my own personal experience of a house&rsquo;s
haunting a spirit; for that House haunted mine.</p>
<p>In all that month&rsquo;s time, I never saw anyone go into the House
nor come out of the House.&nbsp; I supposed that such a thing must take
place sometimes, in the dead of the night, or the glimmer of the morning;
but, I never saw it done.&nbsp; I got no relief from having my curtains
drawn when it came on dark, and shutting out the House.&nbsp; The Eye
then began to shine in my fire.</p>
<p>I am a single old woman.&nbsp; I should say at once, without being
at all afraid of the name, I am an old maid; only that I am older than
the phrase would express.&nbsp; The time was when I had my love-trouble,
but, it is long and long ago.&nbsp; He was killed at sea (Dear Heaven
rest his blessed head!) when I was twenty-five.&nbsp; I have all my
life, since ever I can remember, been deeply fond of children.&nbsp;
I have always felt such a love for them, that I have had my sorrowful
and sinful times when I have fancied something must have gone wrong
in my life&mdash;something must have been turned aside from its original
intention I mean&mdash;or I should have been the proud and happy mother
of many children, and a fond old grandmother this day.&nbsp; I have
soon known better in the cheerfulness and contentment that God has blessed
me with and given me abundant reason for; and yet I have had to dry
my eyes even then, when I have thought of my dear, brave, hopeful, handsome,
bright-eyed Charley, and the trust meant to cheer me with.&nbsp; Charley
was my youngest brother, and he went to India.&nbsp; He married there,
and sent his gentle little wife home to me to be confined, and she was
to go back to him, and the baby was to be left with me, and I was to
bring it up.&nbsp; It never belonged to this life.&nbsp; It took its
silent place among the other incidents in my story that might have been,
but never were.&nbsp; I had hardly time to whisper to her &ldquo;Dead
my own!&rdquo; or she to answer, &ldquo;Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
O lay it on my breast and comfort Charley!&rdquo; when she had gone
to seek her baby at Our Saviour&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; I went to Charley,
and I told him there was nothing left but me, poor me; and I lived with
Charley, out there, several years.&nbsp; He was a man of fifty, when
he fell asleep in my arms.&nbsp; His face had changed to be almost old
and a little stern; but, it softened, and softened when I laid it down
that I might cry and pray beside it; and, when I looked at it for the
last time, it was my dear, untroubled, handsome, youthful Charley of
long ago.</p>
<p>&mdash;I was going on to tell that the loneliness of the House to
Let brought back all these recollections, and that they had quite pierced
my heart one evening, when Flobbins, opening the door, and looking very
much as if she wanted to laugh but thought better of it, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jabez Jarber, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which Mr. Jarber ambled in, in his usual absurd way, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophonisba!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which I am obliged to confess is my name.&nbsp; A pretty one and
proper one enough when it was given to me: but, a good many years out
of date now, and always sounding particularly high-flown and comical
from his lips.&nbsp; So I said, sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though it is Sophonisba, Jarber, you are not obliged to mention
it, that <i>I</i> see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply to this observation, the ridiculous man put the tips of
my five right-hand fingers to his lips, and said again, with an aggravating
accent on the third syllable:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophon<i>is</i>ba!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t burn lamps, because I can&rsquo;t abide the smell of
oil, and wax candles belonged to my day.&nbsp; I hope the convenient
situation of one of my tall old candlesticks on the table at my elbow
will be my excuse for saying, that if he did that again, I would chop
his toes with it. (I am sorry to add that when I told him so, I knew
his toes to be tender.)&nbsp; But, really, at my time of life and at
Jarber&rsquo;s, it is too much of a good thing.&nbsp; There is an orchestra
still standing in the open air at the Wells, before which, in the presence
of a throng of fine company, I have walked a minuet with Jarber.&nbsp;
But, there is a house still standing, in which I have worn a pinafore,
and had a tooth drawn by fastening a thread to the tooth and the door-handle,
and toddling away from the door.&nbsp; And how should I look now, at
my years, in a pinafore, or having a door for my dentist?</p>
<p>Besides, Jarber always was more or less an absurd man.&nbsp; He was
sweetly dressed, and beautifully perfumed, and many girls of my day
would have given their ears for him; though I am bound to add that he
never cared a fig for them, or their advances either, and that he was
very constant to me.&nbsp; For, he not only proposed to me before my
love-happiness ended in sorrow, but afterwards too: not once, nor yet
twice: nor will we say how many times.&nbsp; However many they were,
or however few they were, the last time he paid me that compliment was
immediately after he had presented me with a digestive dinner-pill stuck
on the point of a pin.&nbsp; And I said on that occasion, laughing heartily,
&ldquo;Now, Jarber, if you don&rsquo;t know that two people whose united
ages would make about a hundred and fifty, have got to be old, I do;
and I beg to swallow this nonsense in the form of this pill&rdquo; (which
I took on the spot), &ldquo;and I request to, hear no more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he conducted himself pretty well.&nbsp; He was always
a little squeezed man, was Jarber, in little sprigged waistcoats; and
he had always little legs and a little smile, and a little voice, and
little round-about ways.&nbsp; As long as I can remember him he was
always going little errands for people, and carrying little gossip.&nbsp;
At this present time when he called me &ldquo;Sophonisba!&rdquo; he
had a little old-fashioned lodging in that new neighbourhood of mine.&nbsp;
I had not seen him for two or three years, but I had heard that he still
went out with a little perspective-glass and stood on door-steps in
Saint James&rsquo;s Street, to see the nobility go to Court; and went
in his little cloak and goloshes outside Willis&rsquo;s rooms to see
them go to Almack&rsquo;s; and caught the frightfullest colds, and got
himself trodden upon by coachmen and linkmen, until he went home to
his landlady a mass of bruises, and had to be nursed for a month.</p>
<p>Jarber took off his little fur-collared cloak, and sat down opposite
me, with his little cane and hat in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have no more Sophonisbaing, if <i>you</i> please, Jarber,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call me Sarah.&nbsp; How do you do?&nbsp; I hope
you are pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; And you?&rdquo; said Jarber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as well as an old woman can expect to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarber was beginning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, not old, Sophon&mdash;&rdquo; but I looked at the candlestick,
and he left off; pretending not to have said anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am infirm, of course,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and so are you.&nbsp;
Let us both be thankful it&rsquo;s no worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that you look worried?&rdquo; said Jarber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very possible.&nbsp; I have no doubt it is the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what has worried my Soph-, soft-hearted friend,&rdquo;
said Jarber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something not easy, I suppose, to comprehend.&nbsp; I am worried
to death by a House to Let, over the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarber went with his little tip-toe step to the window-curtains,
peeped out, and looked round at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, in answer: &ldquo;that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After peeping out again, Jarber came back to his chair with a tender
air, and asked: &ldquo;How does it worry you, S-arah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a mystery to me,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course
every house <i>is</i> a mystery, more or less; but, something that I
don&rsquo;t care to mention&rdquo; (for truly the Eye was so slight
a thing to mention that I was more than half ashamed of it), &ldquo;has
made that House so mysterious to me, and has so fixed it in my mind,
that I have had no peace for a month.&nbsp; I foresee that I shall have
no peace, either, until Trottle comes to me, next Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I might have mentioned before, that there is a lone-standing jealousy
between Trottle and Jarber; and that there is never any love lost between
those two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Trottle</i>,&rdquo; petulantly repeated Jarber, with a
little flourish of his cane; &ldquo;how is <i>Trottle</i> to restore
the lost peace of Sarah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will exert himself to find out something about the House.&nbsp;
I have fallen into that state about it, that I really must discover
by some means or other, good or bad, fair or foul, how and why it is
that that House remains To Let.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why Trottle?&nbsp; Why not,&rdquo; putting his little
hat to his heart; &ldquo;why not, Jarber?</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I have never thought of Jarber in the
matter.&nbsp; And now I do think of Jarber, through your having the
kindness to suggest him&mdash;for which I am really and truly obliged
to you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think he could do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be too much for you, Jarber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be coming and going, and fetching and carrying,
Jarber, and you might catch cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah!&nbsp; What can be done by Trottle, can be done by me.&nbsp;
I am on terms of acquaintance with every person of responsibility in
this parish.&nbsp; I am intimate at the Circulating Library.&nbsp; I
converse daily with the Assessed Taxes.&nbsp; I lodge with the Water
Rate.&nbsp; I know the Medical Man.&nbsp; I lounge habitually at the
House Agent&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I dine with the Churchwardens.&nbsp; I move
to the Guardians.&nbsp; Trottle!&nbsp; A person in the sphere of a domestic,
and totally unknown to society!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be warm, Jarber.&nbsp; In mentioning Trottle,
I have naturally relied on my Right-Hand, who would take any trouble
to gratify even a whim of his old mistress&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But, if you
can find out anything to help to unravel the mystery of this House to
Let, I shall be fully as much obliged to you as if there was never a
Trottle in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarber rose and put on his little cloak.&nbsp; A couple of fierce
brass lions held it tight round his little throat; but a couple of the
mildest Hares might have done that, I am sure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I go.&nbsp; Expect me on Monday evening, the Sixth,
when perhaps you will give me a cup of tea;&mdash;may I ask for no Green?&nbsp;
Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was on a Thursday, the second of December.&nbsp; When I reflected
that Trottle would come back on Monday, too, I had my misgivings as
to the difficulty of keeping the two powers from open warfare, and indeed
I was more uneasy than I quite like to confess.&nbsp; However, the empty
House swallowed up that thought next morning, as it swallowed up most
other thoughts now, and the House quite preyed upon me all that day,
and all the Saturday.</p>
<p>It was a very wet Sunday: raining and blowing from morning to night.&nbsp;
When the bells rang for afternoon church, they seemed to ring in the
commotion of the puddles as well as in the wind, and they sounded very
loud and dismal indeed, and the street looked very dismal indeed, and
the House looked dismallest of all.</p>
<p>I was reading my prayers near the light, and my fire was growing
in the darkening window-glass, when, looking up, as I prayed for the
fatherless children and widows and all who were desolate and oppressed,&mdash;I
saw the Eye again.&nbsp; It passed in a moment, as it had done before;
but, this time, I was inwardly more convinced that I had seen it.</p>
<p>Well to be sure, I <i>had</i> a night that night!&nbsp; Whenever
I closed my own eyes, it was to see eyes.&nbsp; Next morning, at an
unreasonably, and I should have said (but for that railroad) an impossibly
early hour, comes Trottle.&nbsp; As soon as he had told me all about
the Wells, I told him all about the House.&nbsp; He listened with as
great interest and attention as I could possibly wish, until I came
to Jabez Jarber, when he cooled in an instant, and became opinionated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Trottle,&rdquo; I said, pretending not to notice, &ldquo;when
Mr. Jarber comes back this evening, we must all lay our heads together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hardly think that would be wanted, ma&rsquo;am; Mr.
Jarber&rsquo;s head is surely equal to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being determined not to notice, I said again, that we must all lay
our heads together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you order, ma&rsquo;am, shall be obeyed.&nbsp; Still,
it cannot be doubted, I should think, that Mr. Jarber&rsquo;s head is
equal, if not superior, to any pressure that can be brought to bear
upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was provoking; and his way, when he came in and out all through
the day, of pretending not to see the House to Let, was more provoking
still.&nbsp; However, being quite resolved not to notice, I gave no
sign whatever that I did notice.&nbsp; But, when evening came, and he
showed in Jarber, and, when Jarber wouldn&rsquo;t be helped off with
his cloak, and poked his cane into cane chair-backs and china ornaments
and his own eye, in trying to unclasp his brazen lions of himself (which
he couldn&rsquo;t do, after all), I could have shaken them both.</p>
<p>As it was, I only shook the tea-pot, and made the tea.&nbsp; Jarber
had brought from under his cloak, a roll of paper, with which he had
triumphantly pointed over the way, like the Ghost of Hamlet&rsquo;s
Father appearing to the late Mr. Kemble, and which he had laid on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A discovery?&rdquo; said I, pointing to it, when he was seated,
and had got his tea-cup.&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Trottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first of a series of discoveries,&rdquo; answered Jarber.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Account of a former tenant, compiled from the Water Rate, and
Medical Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Trottle,&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; For, I saw
him making imperceptibly to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, ma&rsquo;am, I might be in Mr. Jarber&rsquo;s
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarber looked that he decidedly thought he might be.&nbsp; I relieved
myself with a good angry croak, and said&mdash;always determined not
to notice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the goodness to sit down, if you please, Trottle.&nbsp;
I wish you to hear this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trottle bowed in the stiffest manner, and took the remotest chair
he could find.&nbsp; Even that, he moved close to the draught from the
keyhole of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firstly,&rdquo; Jarber began, after sipping his tea, &ldquo;would
my Sophon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin again, Jarber,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be much surprised, if this House to Let should turn
out to be the property of a relation of your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should indeed be very much surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it belongs to your first cousin (I learn, by the way,
that he is ill at this time) George Forley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that is a bad beginning.&nbsp; I cannot deny that George
Forley stands in the relation of first cousin to me; but I hold no communication
with him.&nbsp; George Forley has been a hard, bitter, stony father
to a child now dead.&nbsp; George Forley was most implacable and unrelenting
to one of his two daughters who made a poor marriage.&nbsp; George Forley
brought all the weight of his band to bear as heavily against that crushed
thing, as he brought it to bear lightly, favouringly, and advantageously
upon her sister, who made a rich marriage.&nbsp; I hope that, with the
measure George Forley meted, it may not be measured out to him again.&nbsp;
I will give George Forley no worse wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was strong upon the subject, and I could not keep the tears out
of my eyes; for, that young girl&rsquo;s was a cruel story, and I had
dropped many a tear over it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house being George Forley&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is
almost enough to account for there being a Fate upon it, if Fate there
is.&nbsp; Is there anything about George Forley in those sheets of paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it.&nbsp; Please to read on.&nbsp; Trottle,
why don&rsquo;t you come nearer?&nbsp; Why do you sit mortifying yourself
in those arctic regions?&nbsp; Come nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am; I am quite near enough to Mr. Jarber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarber rounded his chair, to get his back full to my opinionated
friend and servant, and, beginning to read, tossed the words at him
over his (Jabez Jarber&rsquo;s) own ear and shoulder.</p>
<p>He read what follows:</p>
<h2>THE MANCHESTER MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw came from Manchester to London and took the
House To Let.&nbsp; He had been, what is called in Lancashire, a Salesman
for a large manufacturing firm, who were extending their business, and
opening a warehouse in London; where Mr. Openshaw was now to superintend
the business.&nbsp; He rather enjoyed the change of residence; having
a kind of curiosity about London, which he had never yet been able to
gratify in his brief visits to the metropolis.&nbsp; At the same time
he had an odd, shrewd, contempt for the inhabitants; whom he had always
pictured to himself as fine, lazy people; caring nothing but for fashion
and aristocracy, and lounging away their days in Bond Street, and such
places; ruining good English, and ready in their turn to despise him
as a provincial.&nbsp; The hours that the men of business kept in the
city scandalised him too; accustomed as he was to the early dinners
of Manchester folk, and the consequently far longer evenings.&nbsp;
Still, he was pleased to go to London; though he would not for the world
have confessed it, even to himself, and always spoke of the step to
his friends as one demanded of him by the interests of his employers,
and sweetened to him by a considerable increase of salary.&nbsp; His
salary indeed was so liberal that he might have been justified in taking
a much larger House than this one, had he not thought himself bound
to set an example to Londoners of how little a Manchester man of business
cared for show.&nbsp; Inside, however, he furnished the House with an
unusual degree of comfort, and, in the winter time, he insisted on keeping
up as large fires as the grates would allow, in every room where the
temperature was in the least chilly.&nbsp; Moreover, his northern sense
of hospitality was such, that, if he were at home, he could hardly suffer
a visitor to leave the house without forcing meat and drink upon him.&nbsp;
Every servant in the house was well warmed, well fed, and kindly treated;
for their master scorned all petty saving in aught that conduced to
comfort; while he amused himself by following out all his accustomed
habits and individual ways in defiance of what any of his new neighbours
might think.</p>
<p>His wife was a pretty, gentle woman, of suitable age and character.&nbsp;
He was forty-two, she thirty-five.&nbsp; He was loud and decided; she
soft and yielding.&nbsp; They had two children or rather, I should say,
she had two; for the elder, a girl of eleven, was Mrs. Openshaw&rsquo;s
child by Frank Wilson her first husband.&nbsp; The younger was a little
boy, Edwin, who could just prattle, and to whom his father delighted
to speak in the broadest and most unintelligible Lancashire dialect,
in order to keep up what he called the true Saxon accent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Openshaw&rsquo;s Christian-name was Alice, and her first husband
had been her own cousin.&nbsp; She was the orphan niece of a sea-captain
in Liverpool: a quiet, grave little creature, of great personal attraction
when she was fifteen or sixteen, with regular features and a blooming
complexion.&nbsp; But she was very shy, and believed herself to be very
stupid and awkward; and was frequently scolded by her aunt, her own
uncle&rsquo;s second wife.&nbsp; So when her cousin, Frank Wilson, came
home from a long absence at sea, and first was kind and protective to
her; secondly, attentive and thirdly, desperately in love with her,
she hardly knew how to be grateful enough to him.&nbsp; It is true she
would have preferred his remaining in the first or second stages of
behaviour; for his violent love puzzled and frightened her.&nbsp; Her
uncle neither helped nor hindered the love affair though it was going
on under his own eyes.&nbsp; Frank&rsquo;s step-mother had such a variable
temper, that there was no knowing whether what she liked one day she
would like the next, or not.&nbsp; At length she went to such extremes
of crossness, that Alice was only too glad to shut her eyes and rush
blindly at the chance of escape from domestic tyranny offered her by
a marriage with her cousin; and, liking him better than any one in the
world except her uncle (who was at this time at sea) she went off one
morning and was married to him; her only bridesmaid being the housemaid
at her aunt&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The consequence was, that Frank and his wife
went into lodgings, and Mrs. Wilson refused to see them, and turned
away Norah, the warm-hearted housemaid; whom they accordingly took into
their service.&nbsp; When Captain Wilson returned from his voyage, he
was very cordial with the young couple, and spent many an evening at
their lodgings; smoking his pipe, and sipping his grog; but he told
them that, for quietness&rsquo; sake, he could not ask them to his own
house; for his wife was bitter against them.&nbsp; They were not very
unhappy about this.</p>
<p>The seed of future unhappiness lay rather in Frank&rsquo;s vehement,
passionate disposition; which led him to resent his wife&rsquo;s shyness
and want of demonstration as failures in conjugal duty.&nbsp; He was
already tormenting himself, and her too, in a slighter degree, by apprehensions
and imaginations of what might befall her during his approaching absence
at sea.&nbsp; At last he went to his father and urged him to insist
upon Alice&rsquo;s being once more received under his roof; the more
especially as there was now a prospect of her confinement while her
husband was away on his voyage.&nbsp; Captain Wilson was, as he himself
expressed it, &ldquo;breaking up,&rdquo; and unwilling to undergo the
excitement of a scene; yet he felt that what his son said was true.&nbsp;
So he went to his wife.&nbsp; And before Frank went to sea, he had the
comfort of seeing his wife installed in her old little garret in his
father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; To have placed her in the one best spare
room was a step beyond Mrs. Wilson&rsquo;s powers of submission or generosity.&nbsp;
The worst part about it, however, was that the faithful Norah had to
be dismissed.&nbsp; Her place as housemaid had been filled up; and,
even had it not, she had forfeited Mrs. Wilson&rsquo;s good opinion
for ever.&nbsp; She comforted her young master and mistress by pleasant
prophecies of the time when they would have a household of their own;
of which, in whatever service she might be in the meantime, she should
be sure to form part.&nbsp; Almost the last action Frank Wilson did,
before setting sail, was going with Alice to see Norah once more at
her mother&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; And then he went away.</p>
<p>Alice&rsquo;s father-in-law grew more and more feeble as winter advanced.&nbsp;
She was of great use to her step-mother in nursing and amusing him;
and, although there was anxiety enough in the household, there was perhaps
more of peace than there had been for years; for Mrs. Wilson had not
a bad heart, and was softened by the visible approach of death to one
whom she loved, and touched by the lonely condition of the young creature,
expecting her first confinement in her husband&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp;
To this relenting mood Norah owed the permission to come and nurse Alice
when her baby was born, and to remain to attend on Captain Wilson.</p>
<p>Before one letter had been received from Frank (who had sailed for
the East Indies and China), his father died.&nbsp; Alice was always
glad to remember that he had held her baby in his arms, and kissed and
blessed it before his death.&nbsp; After that, and the consequent examination
into the state of his affairs, it was found that he had left far less
property than people had been led by his style of living to imagine;
and, what money there was, was all settled upon his wife, and at her
disposal after her death.&nbsp; This did not signify much to Alice,
as Frank was now first mate of his ship, and, in another voyage or two,
would be captain.&nbsp; Meanwhile he had left her some hundreds (all
his savings) in the bank.</p>
<p>It became time for Alice to hear from her husband.&nbsp; One letter
from the Cape she had already received.&nbsp; The next was to announce
his arrival in India.&nbsp; As week after week passed over, and no intelligence
of the ship&rsquo;s arrival reached the office of the owners, and the
Captain&rsquo;s wife was in the same state of ignorant suspense as Alice
herself, her fears grew most oppressive.&nbsp; At length the day came
when, in reply to her inquiry at the Shipping Office, they told her
that the owners had given up Hope of ever hearing more of the Betsy-Jane,
and had sent in their claim upon the underwriters.&nbsp; Now that he
was gone for ever, she first felt a yearning, longing love for the kind
cousin, the dear friend, the sympathising protector, whom she should
never see again,&mdash;first felt a passionate desire to show him his
child, whom she had hitherto rather craved to have all to herself&mdash;her
own sole possession.&nbsp; Her grief was, however, noiseless, and quiet&mdash;rather
to the scandal of Mrs. Wilson; who bewailed her step-son as if he and
she had always lived together in perfect harmony, and who evidently
thought it her duty to burst into fresh tears at every strange face
she saw; dwelling on his poor young widow&rsquo;s desolate state, and
the helplessness of the fatherless child, with an unction, as if she
liked the excitement of the sorrowful story.</p>
<p>So passed away the first days of Alice&rsquo;s widowhood.&nbsp; Bye-and-bye
things subsided into their natural and tranquil course.&nbsp; But, as
if this young creature was always to be in some heavy trouble, her ewe-lamb
began to be ailing, pining and sickly.&nbsp; The child&rsquo;s mysterious
illness turned out to be some affection of the spine likely to affect
health; but not to shorten life&mdash;at least so the doctors said.&nbsp;
But the long dreary suffering of one whom a mother loves as Alice loved
her only child, is hard to look forward to.&nbsp; Only Norah guessed
what Alice suffered; no one but God knew.</p>
<p>And so it fell out, that when Mrs. Wilson, the elder, came to her
one day in violent distress, occasioned by a very material diminution
in the value the property that her husband had left her,&mdash;a diminution
which made her income barely enough to support herself, much less Alice&mdash;the
latter could hardly understand how anything which did not touch health
or life could cause such grief; and she received the intelligence with
irritating composure.&nbsp; But when, that afternoon, the little sick
child was brought in, and the grandmother&mdash;who after all loved
it well&mdash;began a fresh moan over her losses to its unconscious
ears&mdash;saying how she had planned to consult this or that doctor,
and to give it this or that comfort or luxury in after yearn but that
now all chance of this had passed away&mdash;Alice&rsquo;s heart was
touched, and she drew near to Mrs. Wilson with unwonted caresses, and,
in a spirit not unlike to that of, Ruth, entreated, that come what would,
they might remain together.&nbsp; After much discussion in succeeding
days, it was arranged that Mrs. Wilson should take a house in Manchester,
furnishing it partly with what furniture she had, and providing the
rest with Alice&rsquo;s remaining two hundred pounds.&nbsp; Mrs. Wilson
was herself a Manchester woman, and naturally longed to return to her
native town.&nbsp; Some connections of her own at that time required
lodgings, for which they were willing to pay pretty handsomely.&nbsp;
Alice undertook the active superintendence and superior work of the
household.&nbsp; Norah, willing faithful Norah, offered to cook, scour,
do anything in short, so that, she might but remain with them.</p>
<p>The plan succeeded.&nbsp; For some years their first lodgers remained
with them, and all went smoothly,&mdash;with the one sad exception of
the little girl&rsquo;s increasing deformity.&nbsp; How that mother
loved that child, is not for words to tell!</p>
<p>Then came a break of misfortune.&nbsp; Their lodgers left, and no
one succeeded to them.&nbsp; After some months they had to remove to
a smaller house; and Alice&rsquo;s tender conscience was torn by the
idea that she ought not to be a burden to her mother-in-law, but ought
to go out and seek her own maintenance.&nbsp; And leave her child!&nbsp;
The thought came like the sweeping boom of a funeral bell over her heart.</p>
<p>Bye-and-bye, Mr. Openshaw came to lodge with them.&nbsp; He had started
in life as the errand-boy and sweeper-out of a warehouse; had struggled
up through all the grades of employment in the place, fighting his way
through the hard striving Manchester life with strong pushing energy
of character.&nbsp; Every spare moment of time had been sternly given
up to self-teaching.&nbsp; He was a capital accountant, a good French
and German scholar, a keen, far-seeing tradesman; understanding markets,
and the bearing of events, both near and distant, on trade: and yet,
with such vivid attention to present details, that I do not think he
ever saw a group of flowers in the fields without thinking whether their
colours would, or would not, form harmonious contrasts in the coming
spring muslins and prints.&nbsp; He went to debating societies, and
threw himself with all his heart and soul into politics; esteeming,
it must be owned, every man a fool or a knave who differed from him,
and overthrowing his opponents rather by the loud strength of his language
than the calm strength if his logic.&nbsp; There was something of the
Yankee in all this.&nbsp; Indeed his theory ran parallel to the famous
Yankee motto&mdash;&ldquo;England flogs creation, and Manchester flogs
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a man, as may be fancied, had had no time
for falling in love, or any such nonsense.&nbsp; At the age when most
young men go through their courting and matrimony, he had not the means
of keeping a wife, and was far too practical to think of having one.&nbsp;
And now that he was in easy circumstances, a rising man, he considered
women almost as incumbrances to the world, with whom a man had better
have as little to do as possible.&nbsp; His first impression of Alice
was indistinct, and he did not care enough about her to make it distinct.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A pretty yea-nay kind of woman,&rdquo; would have been his description
of her, if he had been pushed into a corner.&nbsp; He was rather afraid,
in the beginning, that her quiet ways arose from a listlessness and
laziness of character which would have been exceedingly discordant to
his active energetic nature.&nbsp; But, when he found out the punctuality
with which his wishes were attended to, and her work was done; when
he was called in the morning at the very stroke of the clock, his shaving-water
scalding hot, his fire bright, his coffee made exactly as his peculiar
fancy dictated, (for he was a man who had his theory about everything,
based upon what he knew of science, and often perfectly original)&mdash;then
he began to think: not that Alice had any peculiar merit; but that he
had got into remarkably good lodgings: his restlessness wore away, and
he began to consider himself as almost settled for life in them.</p>
<p>Mr. Openshaw had been too busy, all his life, to be introspective.&nbsp;
He did not know that he had any tenderness in his nature; and if he
had become conscious of its abstract existence, he would have considered
it as a manifestation of disease in some part of his nature.&nbsp; But
he was decoyed into pity unawares; and pity led on to tenderness.&nbsp;
That little helpless child&mdash;always carried about by one of the
three busy women of the house, or else patiently threading coloured
beads in the chair from which, by no effort of its own, could it ever
move; the great grave blue eyes, full of serious, not uncheerful, expression,
giving to the small delicate face a look beyond its years; the soft
plaintive voice dropping out but few words, so unlike the continual
prattle of a child&mdash;caught Mr. Openshaw&rsquo;s attention in spite
of himself.&nbsp; One day&mdash;he half scorned himself for doing so&mdash;he
cut short his dinner-hour to go in search of some toy which should take
the place of those eternal beads.&nbsp; I forget what he bought; but,
when he gave the present (which he took care to do in a short abrupt
manner, and when no one was by to see him) he was almost thrilled by
the flash of delight that came over that child&rsquo;s face, and could
not help all through that afternoon going over and over again the picture
left on his memory, by the bright effect of unexpected joy on the little
girl&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; When he returned home, he found his slippers
placed by his sitting-room fire; and even more careful attention paid
to his fancies than was habitual in those model lodgings.&nbsp; When
Alice had taken the last of his tea-things away&mdash;she had been silent
as usual till then&mdash;she stood for an instant with the door in her
hand.&nbsp; Mr. Openshaw looked as if he were deep in his book, though
in fact he did not see a line; but was heartily wishing the woman would
be gone, and not make any palaver of gratitude.&nbsp; But she only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, sir.&nbsp; Thank you very much,&rdquo;
and was gone, even before he could send her away with a &ldquo;There,
my good woman, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time longer he took no apparent notice of the child.&nbsp;
He even hardened his heart into disregarding her sudden flush of colour,
and little timid smile of recognition, when he saw her by chance.&nbsp;
But, after all, this could not last for ever; and, having a second time
given way to tenderness, there was no relapse.&nbsp; The insidious enemy
having thus entered his heart, in the guise of compassion to the child,
soon assumed the more dangerous form of interest in the mother.&nbsp;
He was aware of this change of feeling, despised himself for it, struggled
with it nay, internally yielded to it and cherished it, long before
he suffered the slightest expression of it, by word, action, or look,
to escape him.&nbsp; He watched Alice&rsquo;s docile obedient ways to
her stepmother; the love which she had inspired in the rough Norah (roughened
by the wear and tear of sorrow and years); but above all, he saw the
wild, deep, passionate affection existing between her and her child.&nbsp;
They spoke little to any one else, or when any one else was by; but,
when alone together, they talked, and murmured, and cooed, and chattered
so continually, that Mr. Openshaw first wondered what they could find
to say to each other, and next became irritated because they were always
so grave and silent with him.&nbsp; All this time, he was perpetually
devising small new pleasures for the child.&nbsp; His thoughts ran,
in a pertinacious way, upon the desolate life before her; and often
he came back from his day&rsquo;s work loaded with the very thing Alice
had been longing for, but had not been able to procure.&nbsp; One time
it was a little chair for drawing the little sufferer along the streets,
and many an evening that ensuing summer Mr. Openshaw drew her along
himself, regardless of the remarks of his acquaintances.&nbsp; One day
in autumn he put down his newspaper, as Alice came in with the breakfast,
and said, in as indifferent a voice as he could assume:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Frank, is there any reason why we two should not put
up our horses together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice stood still in perplexed wonder.&nbsp; What did he mean?&nbsp;
He had resumed the reading of his newspaper, as if he did not expect
any answer; so she found silence her safest course, and went on quietly
arranging his breakfast without another word passing between them.&nbsp;
Just as he was leaving the house, to go to the warehouse as usual, he
turned back and put his head into the bright, neat, tidy kitchen, where
all the women breakfasted in the morning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think of what I said, Mrs. Frank&rdquo; (this
was her name with the lodgers), &ldquo;and let me have your opinion
upon it to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice was thankful that her mother and Norah were too busy talking
together to attend much to this speech.&nbsp; She determined not to
think about it at all through the day; and, of course, the effort not
to think made her think all the more.&nbsp; At night she sent up Norah
with his tea.&nbsp; But Mr. Openshaw almost knocked Norah down as she
was going out at the door, by pushing past her and calling out &ldquo;Mrs.
Frank!&rdquo; in an impatient voice, at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>Alice went up, rather than seem to have affixed too much meaning
to his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Frank,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what answer?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t make it too long; for I have lots of office-work to get
through to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what you meant, sir,&rdquo; said truthful Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I should have thought you might have guessed.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re not new at this sort of work, and I am.&nbsp; However,
I&rsquo;ll make it plain this time.&nbsp; Will you have me to be thy
wedded husband, and serve me, and love me, and honour me, and all that
sort of thing?&nbsp; Because if you will, I will do as much by you,
and be a father to your child&mdash;and that&rsquo;s more than is put
in the prayer-book.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m a man of my word; and what
I say, I feel; and what I promise, I&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; Now, for your
answer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice was silent.&nbsp; He began to make the tea, as if her reply
was a matter of perfect indifference to him; but, as soon as that was
done, he became impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long, sir, may I have to think over it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three minutes!&rdquo; (looking at his watch).&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
had two already&mdash;that makes five.&nbsp; Be a sensible woman, say
Yes, and sit down to tea with me, and we&rsquo;ll talk it over together;
for, after tea, I shall be busy; say No&rdquo; (he hesitated a moment
to try and keep his voice in the same tone), &ldquo;and I shan&rsquo;t
say another word about it, but pay up a year&rsquo;s rent for my rooms
to-morrow, and be off.&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s up!&nbsp; Yes or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&mdash;you have been so good to little
Ailsie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, sit down comfortably by me on the sofa, and let us
have our tea together.&nbsp; I am glad to find you are as good and sensible
as I took for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was Alice Wilson&rsquo;s second wooing.</p>
<p>Mr. Openshaw&rsquo;s will was too strong, and his circumstances too
good, for him not to carry all before him.&nbsp; He settled Mrs. Wilson
in a comfortable house of her own, and made her quite independent of
lodgers.&nbsp; The little that Alice said with regard to future plans
was in Norah&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Openshaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Norah shall take
care of the old lady as long as she lives; and, after that, she shall
either come and live with us, or, if she likes it better, she shall
have a provision for life&mdash;for your sake, missus.&nbsp; No one
who has been good to you or the child shall go unrewarded.&nbsp; But
even the little one will be better for some fresh stuff about her.&nbsp;
Get her a bright, sensible girl as a nurse: one who won&rsquo;t go rubbing
her with calf&rsquo;s-foot jelly as Norah does; wasting good stuff outside
that ought to go in, but will follow doctors&rsquo; directions; which,
as you must see pretty clearly by this time, Norah won&rsquo;t; because
they give the poor little wench pain.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m not above
being nesh for other folks myself.&nbsp; I can stand a good blow, and
never change colour; but, set me in the operating-room in the infirmary,
and I turn as sick as a girl.&nbsp; Yet, if need were, I would hold
the little wench on my knees while she screeched with pain, if it were
to do her poor back good.&nbsp; Nay, nay, wench! keep your white looks
for the time when it comes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say it ever will.&nbsp;
But this I know, Norah will spare the child and cheat the doctor if
she can.&nbsp; Now, I say, give the bairn a year or two&rsquo;s chance,
and then, when the pack of doctors have done their best&mdash;and, maybe,
the old lady has gone&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have Norah back, or do better
for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pack of doctors could do no good to little Ailsie.&nbsp; She
was beyond their power.&nbsp; But her father (for so he insisted on
being called, and also on Alice&rsquo;s no longer retaining the appellation
of Mama, but becoming henceforward Mother), by his healthy cheerfulness
of manner, his clear decision of purpose, his odd turns and quirks of
humour, added to his real strong love for the helpless little girl,
infused a new element of brightness and confidence into her life; and,
though her back remained the same, her general health was strengthened,
and Alice&mdash;never going beyond a smile herself&mdash;had the pleasure
of seeing her child taught to laugh.</p>
<p>As for Alice&rsquo;s own life, it was happier than it had ever been.&nbsp;
Mr. Openshaw required no demonstration, no expressions of affection
from her.&nbsp; Indeed, these would rather have disgusted him.&nbsp;
Alice could love deeply, but could not talk about it.&nbsp; The perpetual
requirement of loving words, looks, and caresses, and misconstruing
their absence into absence of love, had been the great trial of her
former married life.&nbsp; Now, all went on clear and straight, under
the guidance of her husband&rsquo;s strong sense, warm heart, and powerful
will.&nbsp; Year by year their worldly prosperity increased.&nbsp; At
Mrs. Wilson&rsquo;s death, Norah came back to them, as nurse to the
newly-born little Edwin; into which post she was not installed without
a pretty strong oration on the part of the proud and happy father; who
declared that if he found out that Norah ever tried to screen the boy
by a falsehood, or to make him nesh either in body or mind, she should
go that very day.&nbsp; Norah and Mr. Openshaw were not on the most
thoroughly cordial terms; neither of them fully recognising or appreciating
the other&rsquo;s best qualities.</p>
<p>This was the previous history of the Lancashire family who had now
removed to London, and had come to occupy the House.</p>
<p>They had been there about a year, when Mr. Openshaw suddenly informed
his wife that he had determined to heal long-standing feuds, and had
asked his uncle and aunt Chadwick to come and pay them a visit and see
London.&nbsp; Mrs. Openshaw had never seen this uncle and aunt of her
husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Years before she had married him, there had been
a quarrel.&nbsp; All she knew was, that Mr. Chadwick was a small manufacturer
in a country town in South Lancashire.&nbsp; She was extremely pleased
that the breach was to be healed, and began making preparations to render
their visit pleasant.</p>
<p>They arrived at last.&nbsp; Going to see London was such an event
to them, that Mrs. Chadwick had made all new linen fresh for the occasion-from
night-caps downwards; and, as for gowns, ribbons, and collars, she might
have been going into the wilds of Canada where never a shop is, so large
was her stock.&nbsp; A fortnight before the day of her departure for
London, she had formally called to take leave of all her acquaintance;
saying she should need all the intermediate time for packing up.&nbsp;
It was like a second wedding in her imagination; and, to complete the
resemblance which an entirely new wardrobe made between the two events,
her husband brought her back from Manchester, on the last market-day
before they set off, a gorgeous pearl and amethyst brooch, saying, &ldquo;Lunnon
should see that Lancashire folks knew a handsome thing when they saw
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time after Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick arrived at the Openshaws&rsquo;,
there was no opportunity for wearing this brooch; but at length they
obtained an order to see Buckingham Palace, and the spirit of loyalty
demanded that Mrs. Chadwick should wear her best clothes in visiting
the abode of her sovereign.&nbsp; On her return, she hastily changed
her dress; for Mr. Openshaw had planned that they should go to Richmond,
drink tea and return by moonlight.&nbsp; Accordingly, about five o&rsquo;clock,
Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw and Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick set off.</p>
<p>The housemaid and cook sate below, Norah hardly knew where.&nbsp;
She was always engrossed in the nursery, in tending her two children,
and in sitting by the restless, excitable Ailsie till she fell asleep.&nbsp;
Bye-and-bye, the housemaid Bessy tapped gently at the door.&nbsp; Norah
went to her, and they spoke in whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse! there&rsquo;s some one down-stairs wants you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wants me!&nbsp; Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman?&nbsp; Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! a man, then, and he asks for you, and he rung at the
front door bell, and has walked into the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should never have let him,&rdquo; exclaimed Norah, &ldquo;master
and missus out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not want him to come in; but when he heard you lived
here, he walked past me, and sat down on the first chair, and said,
&lsquo;Tell her to come and speak to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no gas
lighted in the room, and supper is all set out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be off with the spoons!&rdquo; exclaimed Norah,
putting the housemaid&rsquo;s fear into words, and preparing to leave
the room, first, however, giving a look to Ailsie, sleeping soundly
and calmly.</p>
<p>Down-stairs she went, uneasy fears stirring in her bosom.&nbsp; Before
she entered the dining-room she provided herself with a candle, and,
with it in her hand, she went in, looking round her in the darkness
for her visitor.</p>
<p>He was standing up, holding by the table.&nbsp; Norah and he looked
at each other; gradual recognition coming into their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah?&rdquo; at length he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Norah, with the sharp tones of alarm
and incredulity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you:&rdquo; trying,
by futile words of disbelief, to do away with the terrible fact before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I so changed?&rdquo; he said, pathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
daresay I am.&nbsp; But, Norah, tell me!&rdquo; he breathed hard, &ldquo;where
is my wife?&nbsp; Is she&mdash;is she alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came nearer to Norah, and would have taken her hand; but she backed
away from him; looking at him all the time with staring eyes, as if
he were some horrible object.&nbsp; Yet he was a handsome, bronzed,
good-looking fellow, with beard and moustache, giving him a foreign-looking
aspect; but his eyes! there was no mistaking those eager, beautiful
eyes&mdash;the very same that Norah had watched not half-an-hour ago,
till sleep stole softly over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Norah&mdash;I can bear it&mdash;I have feared it
so often.&nbsp; Is she dead?&rdquo;&nbsp; Norah still kept silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is dead!&rdquo;&nbsp; He hung on Norah&rsquo;s words and
looks, as if for confirmation or contradiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; groaned Norah.&nbsp; &ldquo;O, sir!
why did you come? how did you find me out? where have you been?&nbsp;
We thought you dead, we did, indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; She poured out words
and questions to gain time, as if time would help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah! answer me this question, straight, by yes or no&mdash;Is
my wife dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she is not!&rdquo; said Norah, slowly and heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O what a relief!&nbsp; Did she receive my letters?&nbsp; But
perhaps you don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Why did you leave her?&nbsp; Where
is she?&nbsp; O Norah, tell me all quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Frank!&rdquo; said Norah at last, almost driven to bay
by her terror lest her mistress should return at any moment, and find
him there&mdash;unable to consider what was best to be done or said-rushing
at something decisive, because she could not endure her present state:
&ldquo;Mr. Frank! we never heard a line from you, and the shipowners
said you had gone down, you and every one else.&nbsp; We thought you
were dead, if ever man was, and poor Miss Alice and her little sick,
helpless child!&nbsp; O, sir, you must guess it,&rdquo; cried the poor
creature at last, bursting out into a passionate fit of crying, &ldquo;for
indeed I cannot tell it.&nbsp; But it was no one&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp;
God help us all this night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah had sate down.&nbsp; She trembled too much to stand.&nbsp;
He took her hands in his.&nbsp; He squeezed them hard, as if by physical
pressure, the truth could be wrung out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah!&rdquo;&nbsp; This time his tone was calm, stagnant
as despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has married again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah shook her head sadly.&nbsp; The grasp slowly relaxed.&nbsp;
The man had fainted.</p>
<p>There was brandy in the room.&nbsp; Norah forced some drops into
Mr. Frank&rsquo;s mouth, chafed his hands, and&mdash;when mere animal
life returned, before the mind poured in its flood of memories and thoughts&mdash;she
lifted him up, and rested his head against her knees.&nbsp; Then she
put a few crumbs of bread taken from the supper-table, soaked in brandy
into his mouth.&nbsp; Suddenly he sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&nbsp; Tell me this instant.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
looked so wild, so mad, so desperate, that Norah felt herself to be
in bodily danger; but her time of dread had gone by.&nbsp; She had been
afraid to tell him the truth, and then she had been a coward.&nbsp;
Now, her wits were sharpened by the sense of his desperate state.&nbsp;
He must leave the house.&nbsp; She would pity him afterwards; but now
she must rather command and upbraid; for he must leave the house before
her mistress came home.&nbsp; That one necessity stood clear before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not here; that is enough for you to know.&nbsp; Nor
can I say exactly where she is&rdquo; (which was true to the letter
if not to the spirit).&nbsp; &ldquo;Go away, and tell me where to find
you to-morrow, and I will tell you all.&nbsp; My master and mistress
may come back at any minute, and then what would become of me with a
strange man in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such an argument was too petty to touch his excited mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for your master and mistress.&nbsp; If
your master is a man, he must feel for me poor shipwrecked sailor that
I am&mdash;kept for years a prisoner amongst savages, always, always,
always thinking of my wife and my home&mdash;dreaming of her by night,
talking to her, though she could not hear, by day.&nbsp; I loved her
more than all heaven and earth put together.&nbsp; Tell me where she
is, this instant, you wretched woman, who salved over her wickedness
to her, as you do to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clock struck ten.&nbsp; Desperate positions require desperate
measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will leave the house now, I will come to you to-morrow
and tell you all.&nbsp; What is more, you shall see your child now.&nbsp;
She lies sleeping up-stairs.&nbsp; O, sir, you have a child, you do
not know that as yet&mdash;a little weakly girl&mdash;with just a heart
and soul beyond her years.&nbsp; We have reared her up with such care:
We watched her, for we thought for many a year she might die any day,
and we tended her, and no hard thing has come near her, and no rough
word has ever been said to her.&nbsp; And now you, come and will take
her life into your hand, and will crush it.&nbsp; Strangers to her have
been kind to her; but her own father&mdash;Mr. Frank, I am her nurse,
and I love her, and I tend her, and I would do anything for her that
I could.&nbsp; Her mother&rsquo;s heart beats as hers beats; and, if
she suffers a pain, her mother trembles all over.&nbsp; If she is happy,
it is her mother that smiles and is glad.&nbsp; If she is growing stronger,
her mother is healthy: if she dwindles, her mother languishes.&nbsp;
If she dies&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know: it is not every one can
lie down and die when they wish it.&nbsp; Come up-stairs, Mr. Frank,
and see your child.&nbsp; Seeing her will do good to your poor heart.&nbsp;
Then go away, in God&rsquo;s name, just this one night-to-morrow, if
need be, you can do anything&mdash;kill us all if you will, or show
yourself&mdash;a great grand man, whom God will bless for ever and ever.&nbsp;
Come, Mr. Frank, the look of a sleeping child is sure to give peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led him up-stairs; at first almost helping his steps, till they
came near the nursery door.&nbsp; She had almost forgotten the existence
of little Edwin.&nbsp; It struck upon her with affright as the shaded
light fell upon the other cot; but she skilfully threw that corner of
the room into darkness, and let the light fall on the sleeping Ailsie.&nbsp;
The child had thrown down the coverings, and her deformity, as she lay
with her back to them, was plainly visible through her slight night-gown.&nbsp;
Her little face, deprived of the lustre of her eyes, looked wan and
pinched, and had a pathetic expression in it, even as she slept.&nbsp;
The poor father looked and looked with hungry, wistful eyes, into which
the big tears came swelling up slowly, and dropped heavily down, as
he stood trembling and shaking all over.&nbsp; Norah was angry with
herself for growing impatient of the length of time that long lingering
gaze lasted.&nbsp; She thought that she waited for full half-an-hour
before Frank stirred.&nbsp; And then&mdash;instead of going away&mdash;he
sank down on his knees by the bedside, and buried his face in the clothes.&nbsp;
Little Ailsie stirred uneasily.&nbsp; Norah pulled him up in terror.&nbsp;
She could afford no more time even for prayer in her extremity of fear;
for surely the next moment would bring her mistress home.&nbsp; She
took him forcibly by the arm; but, as he was going, his eye lighted
on the other bed: he stopped.&nbsp; Intelligence came back into his
face.&nbsp; His hands clenched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His child?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her child,&rdquo; replied Norah.&nbsp; &ldquo;God watches
over him,&rdquo; said she instinctively; for Frank&rsquo;s looks excited
her fears, and she needed to remind herself of the Protector of the
helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God has not watched over me,&rdquo; he said, in despair; his
thoughts apparently recoiling on his own desolate, deserted state.&nbsp;
But Norah had no time for pity.&nbsp; To-morrow she would be as compassionate
as her heart prompted.&nbsp; At length she guided him downstairs and
shut the outer door and bolted it&mdash;as if by bolts to keep out facts.</p>
<p>Then she went back into the dining-room and effaced all traces of
his presence as far as she could.&nbsp; She went upstairs to the nursery
and sate there, her head on her hand, thinking what was to come of all
this misery.&nbsp; It seemed to her very long before they did return;
yet it was hardly eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; She so heard the loud,
hearty Lancashire voices on the stairs; and, for the first time, she
understood the contrast of the desolation of the poor man who had so
lately gone forth in lonely despair.</p>
<p>It almost put her out of patience to see Mrs. Openshaw come in, calmly
smiling, handsomely dressed, happy, easy, to inquire after her children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Ailsie go to sleep comfortably?&rdquo; she whispered to
Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother bent over her, looking at her slumbers with the soft eyes
of love.&nbsp; How little she dreamed who had looked on her last!&nbsp;
Then she went to Edwin, with perhaps less wistful anxiety in her countenance,
but more of pride.&nbsp; She took off her things, to go down to supper.&nbsp;
Norah saw her no more that night.</p>
<p>Beside the door into the passage, the sleeping-nursery opened out
of Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw&rsquo;s room, in order that they might have
the children more immediately under their own eyes.&nbsp; Early the
next summer morning Mrs. Openshaw was awakened by Ailsie&rsquo;s startled
call of &ldquo;Mother! mother!&rdquo;&nbsp; She sprang up, put on her
dressing-gown, and went to her child.&nbsp; Ailsie was only half awake,
and in a not uncommon state of terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he, mother?&nbsp; Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, my darling?&nbsp; No one is here.&nbsp; You have been
dreaming love.&nbsp; Waken up quite.&nbsp; See, it is broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ailsie, looking round her; then clinging
to her mother, said, &ldquo;but a man was here in the night, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, little goose.&nbsp; No man has ever come near you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&nbsp; He stood there.&nbsp; Just by Norah.&nbsp;
A man with hair and a beard.&nbsp; And he knelt down and said his prayers.&nbsp;
Norah knows he was here, mother&rdquo; (half angrily, as Mrs. Openshaw
shook her head in smiling incredulity).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! we will ask Norah when she comes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Openshaw,
soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t talk any more about him
now.&nbsp; It is not five o&rsquo;clock; it is too early for you to
get up.&nbsp; Shall I fetch you a book and read to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, mother,&rdquo; said the child, clinging
to her.&nbsp; So Mrs. Openshaw sate on the bedside talking to Ailsie,
and telling her of what they had done at Richmond the evening before,
until the little girl&rsquo;s eyes slowly closed and she once more fell
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the matter?&rdquo; asked Mr. Openshaw, as his wife
returned to bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ailsie wakened up in a fright, with some
story of a man having been in the room to say his prayers,&mdash;a dream,
I suppose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And no more was said at the time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Openshaw had almost forgotten the whole affair when she got
up about seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; But, bye-and-bye, she heard a sharp
altercation going on in the nursery.&nbsp; Norah speaking angrily to
Ailsie, a most unusual thing.&nbsp; Both Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw listened
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Ailsie; let me hear none of your dreams;
never let me hear you tell that story again!&rdquo; Ailsie began to
cry.</p>
<p>Mr. Openshaw opened the door of communication before his wife could
say a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse stood at the door, defiant.&nbsp; She perceived she had
been heard, but she was desperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me hear you speak in that manner to Ailsie
again,&rdquo; he said sternly, and shut the door.</p>
<p>Norah was infinitely relieved; for she had dreaded some questioning;
and a little blame for sharp speaking was what she could well bear,
if cross-examination was let alone.</p>
<p>Down-stairs they went, Mr. Openshaw carrying Ailsie; the sturdy Edwin
coming step by step, right foot foremost, always holding his mother&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Each child was placed in a chair by the breakfast-table,
and then Mr. and Mrs. Openshaw stood together at the window, awaiting
their visitors&rsquo; appearance and making plans for the day.&nbsp;
There was a pause.&nbsp; Suddenly Mr. Openshaw turned to Ailsie, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a little goosy somebody is with her dreams, waking up
poor, tired mother in the middle of the night with a story of a man
being in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I saw him,&rdquo; said Ailsie,
half crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make Norah angry; but
I was not asleep, for all she says I was.&nbsp; I had been asleep,&mdash;and
I awakened up quite wide awake though I was so frightened.&nbsp; I kept
my eyes nearly shut, and I saw the man quite plain.&nbsp; A great brown
man with a beard.&nbsp; He said his prayers.&nbsp; And then he looked
at Edwin.&nbsp; And then Norah took him by the arm and led him away,
after they had whispered a bit together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my little woman must be reasonable,&rdquo; said Mr. Openshaw,
who was always patient with Ailsie.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was no man in
the house last night at all.&nbsp; No man comes into the house as you
know, if you think; much less goes up into the nursery.&nbsp; But sometimes
we dream something has happened, and the dream is so like reality, that
you are not the first person, little woman, who has stood out that the
thing has really happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, indeed it was not a dream!&rdquo; said Ailsie, beginning
to cry.</p>
<p>Just then Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick came down, looking grave and discomposed.&nbsp;
All during breakfast time they were silent and uncomfortable.&nbsp;
As soon as the breakfast things were taken away, and the children had
been carried up-stairs, Mr. Chadwick began in an evidently preconcerted
manner to inquire if his nephew was certain that all his servants were
honest; for, that Mrs. Chadwick had that morning missed a very valuable
brooch, which she had worn the day before.&nbsp; She remembered taking
it off when she came home from Buckingham Palace.&nbsp; Mr. Openshaw&rsquo;s
face contracted into hard lines: grew like what it was before he had
known his wife and her child.&nbsp; He rang the bell even before his
uncle had done speaking.&nbsp; It was answered by the housemaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, was any one here last night while we were away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man, sir, came to speak to Norah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To speak to Norah!&nbsp; Who was he?&nbsp; How long did he
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell, sir.&nbsp; He came&mdash;perhaps
about nine.&nbsp; I went up to tell Norah in the nursery, and she came
down to speak to him.&nbsp; She let him out, sir.&nbsp; She will know
who he was, and how long he stayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited a moment to be asked any more questions, but she was not,
so she went away.</p>
<p>A minute afterwards Openshaw made as though he were going out of
the room; but his wife laid her hand on his arm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not speak to her before the children,&rdquo; she said,
in her low, quiet voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go up and question her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; I must speak to her.&nbsp; You must know,&rdquo;
said he, turning to his uncle and aunt, &ldquo;my missus has an old
servant, as faithful as ever woman was, I do believe, as far as love
goes,&mdash;but, at the same time, who does not always speak truth,
as even the missus must allow.&nbsp; Now, my notion is, that this Norah
of ours has been come over by some good-for-nothin chap (for she&rsquo;s
at the time o&rsquo; life when they say women pray for husbands&mdash;&lsquo;any,
good Lord, any,&rsquo;) and has let him into our house, and the chap
has made off with your brooch, and m&rsquo;appen many another thing
beside.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only saying that Norah is soft-hearted, and
does not stick at a white lie&mdash;that&rsquo;s all, missus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was curious to notice how his tone, his eyes, his whole face changed
as he spoke to his wife; but he was the resolute man through all.&nbsp;
She knew better than to oppose him; so she went up-stairs, and told
Norah her master wanted to speak to her, and that she would take care
of the children in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>Norah rose to go without a word.&nbsp; Her thoughts were these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they tear me to pieces they shall never know through me.&nbsp;
He may come,&mdash;and then just Lord have mercy upon us all: for some
of us are dead folk to a certainty.&nbsp; But he shall do it; not me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may fancy, now, her look of determination as she faced her master
alone in the dining-room; Mr. and Mrs. Chadwick having left the affair
in their nephew&rsquo;s hands, seeing that he took it up with such vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah!&nbsp; Who was that man that came to my house last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; As if infinitely; surprised but it
was only to gain time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the man whom Mary let in; whom she went up-stairs to
the nursery to tell you about; whom you came down to speak to; the same
chap, I make no doubt, whom you took into the nursery to have your talk
out with; whom Ailsie saw, and afterwards dreamed about; thinking, poor
wench! she saw him say his prayers, when nothing, I&rsquo;ll be bound,
was farther from his thoughts; who took Mrs. Chadwick&rsquo;s brooch,
value ten pounds.&nbsp; Now, Norah!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go off!&nbsp;
I am as sure as that my name&rsquo;s Thomas Openshaw, that you knew
nothing of this robbery.&nbsp; But I do think you&rsquo;ve been imposed
on, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; Some good-for-nothing chap has
been making up to you, and you&rsquo;ve been just like all other women,
and have turned a soft place in your heart to him; and he came last
night a-lovyering, and you had him up in the nursery, and he made use
of his opportunities, and made off with a few things on his way down!&nbsp;
Come, now, Norah: it&rsquo;s no blame to you, only you must not be such
a fool again.&nbsp; Tell us,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what name he
gave you, Norah?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be bound it was not the right one;
but it will be a clue for the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah drew herself up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may ask that question, and
taunt me with my being single, and with my credulity, as you will, Master
Openshaw.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get no answer from me.&nbsp; As for the
brooch, and the story of theft and burglary; if any friend ever came
to see me (which I defy you to prove, and deny), he&rsquo;d be just
as much above doing such a thing as you yourself, Mr. Openshaw, and
more so, too; for I&rsquo;m not at all sure as everything you have is
rightly come by, or would be yours long, if every man had his own.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She meant, of course, his wife; but he understood her to refer to his
property in goods and chattels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my good woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
tell you truly, I never trusted you out and out; but my wife liked you,
and I thought you had many a good point about you.&nbsp; If you once
begin to sauce me, I&rsquo;ll have the police to you, and get out the
truth in a court of justice, if you&rsquo;ll not tell it me quietly
and civilly here.&nbsp; Now the best thing you can do is quietly to
tell me who the fellow is.&nbsp; Look here! a man comes to my house;
asks for you; you take him up-stairs, a valuable brooch is missing next
day; we know that you, and Mary, and cook, are honest; but you refuse
to tell us who the man is.&nbsp; Indeed you&rsquo;ve told one lie already
about him, saying no one was here last night.&nbsp; Now I just put it
to you, what do you think a policeman would say to this, or a magistrate?&nbsp;
A magistrate would soon make you tell the truth, my good woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never the creature born that should get it out
of me,&rdquo; said Norah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not unless I choose to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to see,&rdquo; said Mr. Openshaw,
growing angry at the defiance.&nbsp; Then, checking himself, he thought
before he spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah, for your missus&rsquo;s sake I don&rsquo;t want to
go to extremities.&nbsp; Be a sensible woman, if you can.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
no great disgrace, after all, to have been taken in.&nbsp; I ask you
once more&mdash;as a friend&mdash;who was this man whom you let into
my house last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.&nbsp; He repeated the question in an impatient tone.&nbsp;
Still no answer.&nbsp; Norah&rsquo;s lips were set in determination
not to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is but one thing to be done.&nbsp; I shall send
for a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not,&rdquo; said Norah, starting forwards.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall not, sir!&nbsp; No policeman shall touch me.&nbsp;
I know nothing of the brooch, but I know this: ever since I was four-and-twenty
I have thought more of your wife than of myself: ever since I saw her,
a poor motherless girl put upon in her uncle&rsquo;s house, I have thought
more of serving her than of serving myself!&nbsp; I have cared for her
and her child, as nobody ever cared for me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t cast
blame on you, sir, but I say it&rsquo;s ill giving up one&rsquo;s life
to any one; for, at the end, they will turn round upon you, and forsake
you.&nbsp; Why does not my missus come herself to suspect me?&nbsp;
Maybe she is gone for the police?&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t stay here,
either for police, or magistrate, or master.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re an unlucky
lot.&nbsp; I believe there&rsquo;s a curse on you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
leave you this very day.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I leave that poor Ailsie,
too.&nbsp; I will! No good will ever come to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Openshaw was utterly astonished at this speech; most of which
was completely unintelligible to him, as may easily be supposed.&nbsp;
Before he could make up his mind what to say, or what to do, Norah had
left the room.&nbsp; I do not think he had ever really intended to send
for the police to this old servant of his wife&rsquo;s; for he had never
for a moment doubted her perfect honesty.&nbsp; But he had intended
to compel her to tell him who the man was, and in this he was baffled.&nbsp;
He was, consequently, much irritated.&nbsp; He returned to his uncle
and aunt in a state of great annoyance and perplexity, and told them
he could get nothing out of the woman; that some man had been in the
house the night before; but that she refused to tell who he was.&nbsp;
At this moment his wife came in, greatly agitated, and asked what had
happened to Norah; for that she had put on her things in passionate
haste, and had left the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks suspicious,&rdquo; said Mr. Chadwick.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is not the way in which an honest person would have acted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Openshaw kept silence.&nbsp; He was sorely perplexed.&nbsp; But
Mrs. Openshaw turned round on Mr. Chadwick with a sudden fierceness
no one ever saw in her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Norah, uncle!&nbsp; She is gone because
she is deeply hurt at being suspected.&nbsp; O, I wish I had seen her&mdash;that
I had spoken to her myself.&nbsp; She would have told me anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Alice wrung her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; continued Mr. Chadwick to his nephew,
in a lower voice, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you out.&nbsp; You used
to be a word and a blow, and oftenest the blow first; and now, when
there is every cause for suspicion, you just do nought.&nbsp; Your missus
is a very good woman, I grant; but she may have been put upon as well
as other folk, I suppose.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t send for the police,
I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Openshaw, surlily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t clear Norah.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t clear herself, as I believe
she might if she would.&nbsp; Only I wash my hands of it; for I am sure
the woman herself is honest, and she&rsquo;s lived a long time with
my wife, and I don&rsquo;t like her to come to shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she will then be forced to clear herself.&nbsp; That,
at any rate, will be a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, very well!&nbsp; I am heart-sick of the whole business.&nbsp;
Come, Alice, come up to the babies they&rsquo;ll be in a sore way.&nbsp;
I tell you, uncle!&rdquo; he said, turning round once more to Mr. Chadwick,
suddenly and sharply, after his eye had fallen on Alice&rsquo;s wan,
tearful, anxious face; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have none sending for the police
after all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll buy my aunt twice as handsome a brooch this
very day; but I&rsquo;ll not have Norah suspected, and my missus plagued.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and his wife left the room.&nbsp; Mr. Chadwick quietly waited
till he was out of hearing, and then aid to his wife; &ldquo;For all
Tom&rsquo;s heroics, I&rsquo;m just quietly going for a detective, wench.&nbsp;
Thou need&rsquo;st know nought about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the police-station, and made a statement of the case.&nbsp;
He was gratified by the impression which the evidence against Norah
seemed to make.&nbsp; The men all agreed in his opinion, and steps were
to be immediately taken to find out where she was.&nbsp; Most probably,
as they suggested, she had gone at once to the man, who, to all appearance,
was her lover.&nbsp; When Mr. Chadwick asked how they would find her
out? they smiled, shook their heads, and spoke of mysterious but infallible
ways and means.&nbsp; He returned to his nephew&rsquo;s house with a
very comfortable opinion of his own sagacity.&nbsp; He was met by his
wife with a penitent face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O master, I&rsquo;ve found my brooch!&nbsp; It was just sticking
by its pin in the flounce of my brown silk, that I wore yesterday.&nbsp;
I took it off in a hurry, and it must have caught in it; and I hung
up my gown in the closet.&nbsp; Just now, when I was going to fold it
up, there was the brooch! I&rsquo;m very vexed, but I never dreamt but
what it was lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband muttering something very like &ldquo;Confound thee and
thy brooch too!&nbsp; I wish I&rsquo;d never given it thee,&rdquo; snatched
up his hat, and rushed back to the station; hoping to be in time to
stop the police from searching for Norah.&nbsp; But a detective was
already gone off on the errand.</p>
<p>Where was Norah?&nbsp; Half mad with the strain of the fearful secret,
she had hardly slept through the night for thinking what must be done.&nbsp;
Upon this terrible state of mind had come Ailsie&rsquo;s questions,
showing that she had seen the Man, as the unconscious child called her
father.&nbsp; Lastly came the suspicion of her honesty.&nbsp; She was
little less than crazy as she ran up-stairs and dashed on her bonnet
and shawl; leaving all else, even her purse, behind her.&nbsp; In that
house she would not stay.&nbsp; That was all she knew or was clear about.&nbsp;
She would not even see the children again, for fear it should weaken
her.&nbsp; She feared above everything Mr. Frank&rsquo;s return to claim
his wife.&nbsp; She could not tell what remedy there was for a sorrow
so tremendous, for her to stay to witness.&nbsp; The desire of escaping
from the coming event was a stronger motive for her departure than her
soreness about the suspicions directed against her; although this last
had been the final goad to the course she took.&nbsp; She walked away
almost at headlong speed; sobbing as she went, as she had not dared
to do during the past night for fear of exciting wonder in those who
might hear her.&nbsp; Then she stopped.&nbsp; An idea came into her
mind that she would leave London altogether, and betake herself to her
native town of Liverpool.&nbsp; She felt in her pocket for her purse,
as she drew near the Euston Square station with this intention.&nbsp;
She had left it at home.&nbsp; Her poor head aching, her eyes swollen
with crying, she had to stand still, and think, as well as she could,
where next she should bend her steps.&nbsp; Suddenly the thought flashed
into her mind that she would go and find out poor Mr. Frank.&nbsp; She
had been hardly kind to him the night before, though her heart had bled
for him ever since.&nbsp; She remembered his telling her as she inquired
for his address, almost as she had pushed him out of the door, of some
hotel in a street not far distant from Euston Square.&nbsp; Thither
she went: with what intention she hardly knew, but to assuage her conscience
by telling him how much she pitied him.&nbsp; In her present state she
felt herself unfit to counsel, or restrain, or assist, or do ought else
but sympathise and weep.&nbsp; The people of the inn said such a person
had been there; had arrived only the day before; had gone out soon after
his arrival, leaving his luggage in their care; but had never come back.&nbsp;
Norah asked for leave to sit down, and await the gentleman&rsquo;s return.&nbsp;
The landlady&mdash;pretty secure in the deposit of luggage against any
probable injury&mdash;showed her into a room, and quietly locked the
door on the outside.&nbsp; Norah was utterly worn out, and fell asleep&mdash;a
shivering, starting, uneasy slumber, which lasted for hours.</p>
<p>The detective, meanwhile, had come up with her some time before she
entered the hotel, into which he followed her.&nbsp; Asking the landlady
to detain her for an hour or so, without giving any reason beyond showing
his authority (which made the landlady applaud herself a good deal for
having locked her in), he went back to the police-station to report
his proceedings.&nbsp; He could have taken her directly; but his object
was, if possible, to trace out the man who was supposed to have committed
the robbery.&nbsp; Then he heard of the discovery of the brooch; and
consequently did not care to return.</p>
<p>Norah slept till even the summer evening began to close in.&nbsp;
Then up.&nbsp; Some one was at the door.&nbsp; It would be Mr. Frank;
and she dizzily pushed back her ruffled grey hair, which had fallen
over her eyes, and stood looking to see him.&nbsp; Instead, there came
in Mr. Openshaw and a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Norah Kennedy,&rdquo; said Mr. Openshaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, sir,&rdquo; said Norah, &ldquo;I did not touch the brooch;
indeed I did not.&nbsp; O, sir, I cannot live to be thought so badly
of;&rdquo; and very sick and faint, she suddenly sank down on the ground.&nbsp;
To her surprise, Mr. Openshaw raised her up very tenderly.&nbsp; Even
the policeman helped to lay her on the sofa; and, at Mr. Openshaw&rsquo;s
desire, he went for some wine and sandwiches; for the poor gaunt woman
lay there almost as if dead with weariness and exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah!&rdquo; said Mr. Openshaw, in his kindest voice, &ldquo;the
brooch is found.&nbsp; It was hanging to Mrs. Chadwick&rsquo;s gown.&nbsp;
I beg your pardon.&nbsp; Most truly I beg your pardon, for having troubled
you about it.&nbsp; My wife is almost broken-hearted.&nbsp; Eat, Norah,&mdash;or,
stay, first drink this glass of wine,&rdquo; said he, lifting her head,
pouring a little down her throat.</p>
<p>As she drank, she remembered where she was, and who she was waiting
for.&nbsp; She suddenly pushed Mr. Openshaw away, saying, &ldquo;O,
sir, you must go.&nbsp; You must not stop a minute.&nbsp; If he comes
back he will kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Norah!&nbsp; I do not know who &lsquo;he&rsquo; is.&nbsp;
But some one is gone away who will never come back: someone who knew
you, and whom I am afraid you cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, sir,&rdquo; said Norah, her
master&rsquo;s kind and sorrowful manner bewildering her yet more than
his words.&nbsp; The policeman had left the room at Mr. Openshaw&rsquo;s
desire, and they two were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean, when I say some one is gone who will
never come back.&nbsp; I mean that he is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Norah, trembling all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor man has been found in the Thames this morning, drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he drown himself?&rdquo; asked Norah, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God only knows,&rdquo; replied Mr. Openshaw, in the same tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your name and address at our house, were found in his pocket:
that, and his purse, were the only things, that were found upon him.&nbsp;
I am sorry to say it, my poor Norah; but you are required to go and
identify him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo; asked Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say who it is.&nbsp; It is always done, in order that some
reason may be discovered for the suicide&mdash;if suicide it was.&nbsp;
I make no doubt he was the man who came to see you at our house last
night.&nbsp; It is very sad, I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made pauses between
each little clause, in order to try and bring back her senses; which
he feared were wandering&mdash;so wild and sad was her look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Openshaw,&rdquo; said she, at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
a dreadful secret to tell you&mdash;only you must never breathe it to
any one, and you and I must hide it away for ever.&nbsp; I thought to
have done it all by myself, but I see I cannot.&nbsp; Yon poor man&mdash;yes!
the dead, drowned creature is, I fear, Mr. Frank, my mistress&rsquo;s
first husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Openshaw sate down, as if shot.&nbsp; He did not speak; but,
after a while, he signed to Norah to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to me the other night&mdash;when&mdash;God be thanked&mdash;you
were all away at Richmond.&nbsp; He asked me if his wife was dead or
alive.&nbsp; I was a brute, and thought more of our all coming home
than of his sore trial: spoke out sharp, and said she was married again,
and very content and happy: I all but turned him away: and now he lies
dead and cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive me!&rdquo; said Mr. Openshaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive us all!&rdquo; said Norah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yon poor
man needs forgiveness perhaps less than any one among us.&nbsp; He had
been among the savages&mdash;shipwrecked&mdash;I know not what&mdash;and
he had written letters which had never reached my poor missus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw his child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw her&mdash;yes!&nbsp; I took him up, to give his thoughts
another start; for I believed he was going mad on my hands.&nbsp; I
came to seek him here, as I more than half promised.&nbsp; My mind misgave
me when I heard he had never come in.&nbsp; O, sir I it must be him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Openshaw rang the bell.&nbsp; Norah was almost too much stunned
to wonder at what he did.&nbsp; He asked for writing materials, wrote
a letter, and then said to Norah:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am writing to Alice, to say I shall be unavoidably absent
for a few days; that I have found you; that you are well, and send her
your love, and will come home to-morrow.&nbsp; You must go with me to
the Police Court; you must identify the body: I will pay high to keep
name; and details out of the papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are you going, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer her directly.&nbsp; Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah!&nbsp; I must go with you, and look on the face of the
man whom I have so injured,&mdash;unwittingly, it is true; but it seems
to me as if I had killed him.&nbsp; I will lay his head in the grave,
as if he were my only brother: and how he must have hated me!&nbsp;
I cannot go home to my wife till all that I can do for him is done.&nbsp;
Then I go with a dreadful secret on my mind.&nbsp; I shall never speak
of it again, after these days are over.&nbsp; I know you will not, either.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He shook hands with her: and they never named the subject again, the
one to the other.</p>
<p>Norah went home to Alice the next day.&nbsp; Not a word was said
on the cause of her abrupt departure a day or two before.&nbsp; Alice
had been charged by her husband in his letter not to allude to the supposed
theft of the brooch; so she, implicitly obedient to those whom she loved
both by nature and habit, was entirely silent on the subject, only treated
Norah with the most tender respect, as if to make up for unjust suspicion.</p>
<p>Nor did Alice inquire into the reason why Mr. Openshaw had been absent
during his uncle and aunt&rsquo;s visit, after he had once said that
it was unavoidable.&nbsp; He came back, grave and quiet; and, from that
time forth, was curiously changed.&nbsp; More thoughtful, and perhaps
less active; quite as decided in conduct, but with new and different
rules for the guidance of that conduct.&nbsp; Towards Alice he could
hardly be more kind than he had always been; but he now seemed to look
upon her as some one sacred and to be treated with reverence, as well
as tenderness.&nbsp; He throve in business, and made a large fortune,
one half of which was settled upon her.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Long years after these events,&mdash;a few months after her mother
died, Ailsie and her &ldquo;father&rdquo; (as she always called Mr.
Openshaw) drove to a cemetery a little way out of town, and she was
carried to a certain mound by her maid, who was then sent back to the
carriage.&nbsp; There was a head-stone, with F. W. and a date.&nbsp;
That was all.&nbsp; Sitting by the grave, Mr. Openshaw told her the
story; and for the sad fate of that poor father whom she had never seen,
he shed the only tears she ever saw fall from his eyes.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most interesting story, all through,&rdquo; I said, as Jarber
folded up the first of his series of discoveries in triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
story that goes straight to the heart&mdash;especially at the end.&nbsp;
But&rdquo;&mdash;I stopped, and looked at Trottle.</p>
<p>Trottle entered his protest directly in the shape of a cough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I said, beginning to lose my patience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that I want you to speak, and that I don&rsquo;t
want you to cough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Trottle, in a state of
respectful obstinacy which would have upset the temper of a saint.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Relative, I presume, to this story, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Yes!&rdquo; said Jarber.&nbsp; &ldquo;By all means let
us hear what this good man has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; answered Trottle, &ldquo;I want to know
why the House over the way doesn&rsquo;t let, and I don&rsquo;t exactly
see how your story answers the question.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I have
to say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should have liked to contradict my opinionated servant, at that
moment.&nbsp; But, excellent as the story was in itself, I felt that
he had hit on the weak point, so far as Jarber&rsquo;s particular purpose
in reading it was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is what you have to say, is it?&rdquo; repeated Jarber.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I enter this room announcing that I have a series of discoveries,
and you jump instantly to the conclusion that the first of the series
exhausts my resources.&nbsp; Have I your permission, dear lady, to enlighten
this obtuse person, if possible, by reading Number Two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My work is behindhand, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Trottle, moving
to the door, the moment I gave Jarber leave to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop where you are,&rdquo; I said, in my most peremptory manner,
&ldquo;and give Mr. Jarber his fair opportunity of answering your objection
now you have made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trottle sat down with the look of a martyr, and Jarber began to read
with his back turned on the enemy more decidedly than ever.</p>
<h2>GOING INTO SOCIETY</h2>
<p>At one period of its reverses, the House fell into the occupation
of a Showman.&nbsp; He was found registered as its occupier, on the
parish books of the time when he rented the House, and there was therefore
no need of any clue to his name.&nbsp; But, he himself was less easy
to be found; for, he had led a wandering life, and settled people had
lost sight of him, and people who plumed themselves on being respectable
were shy of admitting that they had ever known anything of him.&nbsp;
At last, among the marsh lands near the river&rsquo;s level, that lie
about Deptford and the neighbouring market-gardens, a Grizzled Personage
in velveteen, with a face so cut up by varieties of weather that he
looked as if he had been tattooed, was found smoking a pipe at the door
of a wooden house on wheels.&nbsp; The wooden house was laid up in ordinary
for the winter, near the mouth of a muddy creek; and everything near
it, the foggy river, the misty marshes, and the steaming market-gardens,
smoked in company with the grizzled man.&nbsp; In the midst of this
smoking party, the funnel-chimney of the wooden house on wheels was
not remiss, but took its pipe with the rest in a companionable manner.</p>
<p>On being asked if it were he who had once rented the House to Let,
Grizzled Velveteen looked surprised, and said yes.&nbsp; Then his name
was Magsman?&nbsp; That was it, Toby Magsman&mdash;which lawfully christened
Robert; but called in the line, from a infant, Toby.&nbsp; There was
nothing agin Toby Magsman, he believed?&nbsp; If there was suspicion
of such&mdash;mention it!</p>
<p>There was no suspicion of such, he might rest assured.&nbsp; But,
some inquiries were making about that House, and would he object to
say why he left it?</p>
<p>Not at all; why should he?&nbsp; He left it, along of a Dwarf.</p>
<p>Along of a Dwarf?</p>
<p>Mr. Magsman repeated, deliberately and emphatically, Along of a Dwarf.</p>
<p>Might it be compatible with Mr. Magsman&rsquo;s inclination and convenience
to enter, as a favour, into a few particulars?</p>
<p>Mr. Magsman entered into the following particulars.</p>
<p>It was a long time ago, to begin with;&mdash;afore lotteries and
a deal more was done away with.&nbsp; Mr. Magsman was looking about
for a good pitch, and he see that house, and he says to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have you, if you&rsquo;re to be had.&nbsp; If money&rsquo;ll get you,
I&rsquo;ll have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neighbours cut up rough, and made complaints; but Mr. Magsman
don&rsquo;t know what they <i>would</i> have had.&nbsp; It was a lovely
thing.&nbsp; First of all, there was the canvass, representin the picter
of the Giant, in Spanish trunks and a ruff, who was himself half the
heighth of the house, and was run up with a line and pulley to a pole
on the roof, so that his Ed was coeval with the parapet.&nbsp; Then,
there was the canvass, representin the picter of the Albina lady, showing
her white air to the Army and Navy in correct uniform.&nbsp; Then, there
was the canvass, representin the picter of the Wild Indian a scalpin
a member of some foreign nation.&nbsp; Then, there was the canvass,
representin the picter of a child of a British Planter, seized by two
Boa Constrictors&mdash;not that <i>we</i> never had no child, nor no
Constrictors neither.&nbsp; Similarly, there was the canvass, representin
the picter of the Wild Ass of the Prairies&mdash;not that <i>we</i>
never had no wild asses, nor wouldn&rsquo;t have had &rsquo;em at a
gift.&nbsp; Last, there was the canvass, representin the picter of the
Dwarf, and like him too (considerin), with George the Fourth in such
a state of astonishment at him as His Majesty couldn&rsquo;t with his
utmost politeness and stoutness express.&nbsp; The front of the House
was so covered with canvasses, that there wasn&rsquo;t a spark of daylight
ever visible on that side.&nbsp; &ldquo;MAGSMAN&rsquo;S AMUSEMENTS,&rdquo;
fifteen foot long by two foot high, ran over the front door and parlour
winders.&nbsp; The passage was a Arbour of green baize and gardenstuff.&nbsp;
A barrel-organ performed there unceasing.&nbsp; And as to respectability,&mdash;if
threepence ain&rsquo;t respectable, what is?</p>
<p>But, the Dwarf is the principal article at present, and he was worth
the money.&nbsp; He was wrote up as MAJOR TPSCHOFFKI, OF THE IMPERIAL
BULGRADERIAN BRIGADE.&nbsp; Nobody couldn&rsquo;t pronounce the name,
and it never was intended anybody should.&nbsp; The public always turned
it, as a regular rule, into Chopski.&nbsp; In the line he was called
Chops; partly on that account, and partly because his real name, if
he ever had any real name (which was very dubious), was Stakes.</p>
<p>He was a uncommon small man, he really was.&nbsp; Certainly not so
small as he was made out to be, but where <i>is</i> your Dwarf as is?&nbsp;
He was a most uncommon small man, with a most uncommon large Ed; and
what he had inside that Ed, nobody ever knowed but himself: even supposin
himself to have ever took stock of it, which it would have been a stiff
job for even him to do.</p>
<p>The kindest little man as never growed!&nbsp; Spirited, but not proud.&nbsp;
When he travelled with the Spotted Baby&mdash;though he knowed himself
to be a nat&rsquo;ral Dwarf, and knowed the Baby&rsquo;s spots to be
put upon him artificial, he nursed that Baby like a mother.&nbsp; You
never heerd him give a ill-name to a Giant.&nbsp; He <i>did</i> allow
himself to break out into strong language respectin the Fat Lady from
Norfolk; but that was an affair of the &rsquo;art; and when a man&rsquo;s
&rsquo;art has been trifled with by a lady, and the preference giv to
a Indian, he ain&rsquo;t master of his actions.</p>
<p>He was always in love, of course; every human nat&rsquo;ral phenomenon
is.&nbsp; And he was always in love with a large woman; I never knowed
the Dwarf as could be got to love a small one.&nbsp; Which helps to
keep &rsquo;em the Curiosities they are.</p>
<p>One sing&rsquo;ler idea he had in that Ed of his, which must have
meant something, or it wouldn&rsquo;t have been there.&nbsp; It was
always his opinion that he was entitled to property.&nbsp; He never
would put his name to anything.&nbsp; He had been taught to write, by
the young man without arms, who got his living with his toes (quite
a writing master <i>he</i> was, and taught scores in the line), but
Chops would have starved to death, afore he&rsquo;d have gained a bit
of bread by putting his hand to a paper.&nbsp; This is the more curious
to bear in mind, because HE had no property, nor hope of property, except
his house and a sarser.&nbsp; When I say his house, I mean the box,
painted and got up outside like a reg&rsquo;lar six-roomer, that he
used to creep into, with a diamond ring (or quite as good to look at)
on his forefinger, and ring a little bell out of what the Public believed
to be the Drawing-room winder.&nbsp; And when I say a sarser, I mean
a Chaney sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end
of every Entertainment.&nbsp; His cue for that, he took from me: &ldquo;Ladies
and gentlemen, the little man will now walk three times round the Cairawan,
and retire behind the curtain.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he said anything important,
in private life, he mostly wound it up with this form of words, and
they was generally the last thing he said to me at night afore he went
to bed.</p>
<p>He had what I consider a fine mind&mdash;a poetic mind.&nbsp; His
ideas respectin his property never come upon him so strong as when he
sat upon a barrel-organ and had the handle turned.&nbsp; Arter the wibration
had run through him a little time, he would screech out, &ldquo;Toby,
I feel my property coming&mdash;grind away!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m counting
my guineas by thousands, Toby&mdash;grind away!&nbsp; Toby, I shall
be a man of fortun!&nbsp; I feel the Mint a jingling in me, Toby, and
I&rsquo;m swelling out into the Bank of England!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is
the influence of music on a poetic mind.&nbsp; Not that he was partial
to any other music but a barrel-organ; on the contrary, hated it.</p>
<p>He had a kind of a everlasting grudge agin the Public: which is a
thing you may notice in many phenomenons that get their living out of
it.&nbsp; What riled him most in the nater of his occupation was, that
it kep him out of Society.&nbsp; He was continiwally saying, &ldquo;Toby,
my ambition is, to go into Society.&nbsp; The curse of my position towards
the Public is, that it keeps me hout of Society.&nbsp; This don&rsquo;t
signify to a low beast of a Indian; he an&rsquo;t formed for Society.&nbsp;
This don&rsquo;t signify to a Spotted Baby; <i>he</i> an&rsquo;t formed
for Society.&mdash;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody never could make out what Chops done with his money.&nbsp;
He had a good salary, down on the drum every Saturday as the day came
round, besides having the run of his teeth&mdash;and he was a Woodpecker
to eat&mdash;but all Dwarfs are.&nbsp; The sarser was a little income,
bringing him in so many halfpence that he&rsquo;d carry &rsquo;em for
a week together, tied up in a pocket-handkercher.&nbsp; And yet he never
had money.&nbsp; And it couldn&rsquo;t be the Fat Lady from Norfolk,
as was once supposed; because it stands to reason that when you have
a animosity towards a Indian, which makes you grind your teeth at him
to his face, and which can hardly hold you from Goosing him audible
when he&rsquo;s going through his War-Dance&mdash;it stands to reason
you wouldn&rsquo;t under them circumstances deprive yourself, to support
that Indian in the lap of luxury.</p>
<p>Most unexpected, the mystery come out one day at Egham Races.&nbsp;
The Public was shy of bein pulled in, and Chops was ringin his little
bell out of his drawing-room winder, and was snarlin to me over his
shoulder as he kneeled down with his legs out at the back-door&mdash;for
he couldn&rsquo;t be shoved into his house without kneeling down, and
the premises wouldn&rsquo;t accommodate his legs&mdash;was snarlin,
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a precious Public for you; why the Devil don&rsquo;t
they tumble up?&rdquo; when a man in the crowd holds up a carrier-pigeon,
and cries out, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any person here as has got a
ticket, the Lottery&rsquo;s just drawed, and the number as has come
up for the great prize is three, seven, forty-two!&nbsp; Three, seven,
forty-two!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was givin the man to the Furies myself, for
calling off the Public&rsquo;s attention&mdash;for the Public will turn
away, at any time, to look at anything in preference to the thing showed
&rsquo;em; and if you doubt it, get &rsquo;em together for any indiwidual
purpose on the face of the earth, and send only two people in late,
and see if the whole company an&rsquo;t far more interested in takin
particular notice of them two than of you&mdash;I say, I wasn&rsquo;t
best pleased with the man for callin out, and wasn&rsquo;t blessin him
in my own mind, when I see Chops&rsquo;s little bell fly out of winder
at a old lady, and he gets up and kicks his box over, exposin the whole
secret, and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to
me, &ldquo;Carry me into the wan, Toby, and throw a pail of water over
me or I&rsquo;m a dead man, for I&rsquo;ve come into my property!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twelve thousand odd hundred pound, was Chops&rsquo;s winnins.&nbsp;
He had bought a half-ticket for the twenty-five thousand prize, and
it had come up.&nbsp; The first use he made of his property, was, to
offer to fight the Wild Indian for five hundred pound a side, him with
a poisoned darnin-needle and the Indian with a club; but the Indian
being in want of backers to that amount, it went no further.</p>
<p>Arter he had been mad for a week&mdash;in a state of mind, in short,
in which, if I had let him sit on the organ for only two minutes, I
believe he would have bust&mdash;but we kep the organ from him&mdash;Mr.
Chops come round, and behaved liberal and beautiful to all.&nbsp; He
then sent for a young man he knowed, as had a wery genteel appearance
and was a Bonnet at a gaming-booth (most respectable brought up, father
havin been imminent in the livery stable line but unfort&rsquo;nate
in a commercial crisis, through paintin a old gray, ginger-bay, and
sellin him with a Pedigree), and Mr. Chops said to this Bonnet, who
said his name was Normandy, which it wasn&rsquo;t:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normandy, I&rsquo;m a goin into Society.&nbsp; Will you go
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says Normandy: &ldquo;Do I understand you, Mr. Chops, to hintimate
that the &rsquo;ole of the expenses of that move will be borne by yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; says Mr. Chops.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you shall
have a Princely allowance too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bonnet lifted Mr. Chops upon a chair, to shake hands with him,
and replied in poetry, with his eyes seemingly full of tears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boat is on the shore,<br />
And my bark is on the sea,<br />
And I do not ask for more,<br />
But I&rsquo;ll Go:&mdash;along with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into Society, in a chay and four grays with silk jackets.&nbsp;
They took lodgings in Pall Mall, London, and they blazed away.</p>
<p>In consequence of a note that was brought to Bartlemy Fair in the
autumn of next year by a servant, most wonderful got up in milk-white
cords and tops, I cleaned myself and went to Pall Mall, one evening
appinted.&nbsp; The gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner, and Mr.
Chops&rsquo;s eyes was more fixed in that Ed of his than I thought good
for him.&nbsp; There was three of &rsquo;em (in company, I mean), and
I knowed the third well.&nbsp; When last met, he had on a white Roman
shirt, and a bishop&rsquo;s mitre covered with leopard-skin, and played
the clarionet all wrong, in a band at a Wild Beast Show.</p>
<p>This gent took on not to know me, and Mr. Chops said: &ldquo;Gentlemen,
this is a old friend of former days:&rdquo; and Normandy looked at me
through a eye-glass, and said, &ldquo;Magsman, glad to see you!&rdquo;&mdash;which
I&rsquo;ll take my oath he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Mr. Chops, to git him
convenient to the table, had his chair on a throne (much of the form
of George the Fourth&rsquo;s in the canvass), but he hardly appeared
to me to be King there in any other pint of view, for his two gentlemen
ordered about like Emperors.&nbsp; They was all dressed like May-Day&mdash;gorgeous!&mdash;And
as to Wine, they swam in all sorts.</p>
<p>I made the round of the bottles, first separate (to say I had done
it), and then mixed &rsquo;em all together (to say I had done it), and
then tried two of &rsquo;em as half-and-half, and then t&rsquo;other
two.&nbsp; Altogether, I passed a pleasin evenin, but with a tendency
to feel muddled, until I considered it good manners to get up and say,
&ldquo;Mr. Chops, the best of friends must part, I thank you for the
wariety of foreign drains you have stood so &rsquo;ansome, I looks towards
you in red wine, and I takes my leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Chops replied,
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just hitch me out of this over your right arm,
Magsman, and carry me down-stairs, I&rsquo;ll see you out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I said I couldn&rsquo;t think of such a thing, but he would have it,
so I lifted him off his throne.&nbsp; He smelt strong of Maideary, and
I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking as I carried him down that it was like
carrying a large bottle full of wine, with a rayther ugly stopper, a
good deal out of proportion.</p>
<p>When I set him on the door-mat in the hall, he kep me close to him
by holding on to my coat-collar, and he whispers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;appy, Magsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind, Mr. Chops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t use me well.&nbsp; They an&rsquo;t grateful
to me.&nbsp; They puts me on the mantel-piece when I won&rsquo;t have
in more Champagne-wine, and they locks me in the sideboard when I won&rsquo;t
give up my property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get rid of &rsquo;em, Mr. Chops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in Society together, and
what would Society say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of Society!&rdquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
talking about.&nbsp; When you have once gone into Society, you mustn&rsquo;t
come out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you&rsquo;ll excuse the freedom, Mr. Chops,&rdquo;
were my remark, shaking my head grave, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a pity
you ever went in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Chops shook that deep Ed of his, to a surprisin extent, and slapped
it half a dozen times with his hand, and with more Wice than I thought
were in him.&nbsp; Then, he says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good fellow,
but you don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Good-night, go along.&nbsp; Magsman,
the little man will now walk three times round the Cairawan, and retire
behind the curtain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last I see of him on that occasion
was his tryin, on the extremest werge of insensibility, to climb up
the stairs, one by one, with his hands and knees.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d
have been much too steep for him, if he had been sober; but he wouldn&rsquo;t
be helped.</p>
<p>It warn&rsquo;t long after that, that I read in the newspaper of
Mr. Chops&rsquo;s being presented at court.&nbsp; It was printed, &ldquo;It
will be recollected&rdquo;&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve noticed in my life,
that it is sure to be printed that it <i>will</i> be recollected, whenever
it won&rsquo;t&mdash;&ldquo;that Mr. Chops is the individual of small
stature, whose brilliant success in the last State Lottery attracted
so much attention.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, I says to myself, Such is Life!&nbsp;
He has been and done it in earnest at last.&nbsp; He has astonished
George the Fourth!</p>
<p>(On account of which, I had that canvass new-painted, him with a
bag of money in his hand, a presentin it to George the Fourth, and a
lady in Ostrich Feathers fallin in love with him in a bag-wig, sword,
and buckles correct.)</p>
<p>I took the House as is the subject of present inquiries&mdash;though
not the honour of bein acquainted&mdash;and I run Magsman&rsquo;s Amusements
in it thirteen months&mdash;sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
sometimes nothin particular, but always all the canvasses outside.&nbsp;
One night, when we had played the last company out, which was a shy
company, through its raining Heavens hard, I was takin a pipe in the
one pair back along with the young man with the toes, which I had taken
on for a month (though he never drawed&mdash;except on paper), and I
heard a kickin at the street door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; I says
to the young man, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;&nbsp; He rubs his eyebrows
with his toes, and he says, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, Mr. Magsman&rdquo;&mdash;which
he never could imagine nothin, and was monotonous company.</p>
<p>The noise not leavin off, I laid down my pipe, and I took up a candle,
and I went down and opened the door.&nbsp; I looked out into the street;
but nothin could I see, and nothin was I aware of, until I turned round
quick, because some creetur run between my legs into the passage.&nbsp;
There was Mr. Chops!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;take me, on the old terms,
and you&rsquo;ve got me; if it&rsquo;s done, say done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was all of a maze, but I said, &ldquo;Done, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done to your done, and double done!&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you got a bit of supper in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bearin in mind them sparklin warieties of foreign drains as we&rsquo;d
guzzled away at in Pall Mall, I was ashamed to offer him cold sassages
and gin-and-water; but he took &rsquo;em both and took &rsquo;em free;
havin a chair for his table, and sittin down at it on a stool, like
hold times.&nbsp; I, all of a maze all the while.</p>
<p>It was arter he had made a clean sweep of the sassages (beef, and
to the best of my calculations two pound and a quarter), that the wisdom
as was in that little man began to come out of him like prespiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;look upon me!&nbsp; You see
afore you, One as has both gone into Society and come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; You <i>are</i> out of it, Mr. Chops?&nbsp; How did
you get out, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SOLD OUT!&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; You never saw the like of
the wisdom as his Ed expressed, when he made use of them two words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend Magsman, I&rsquo;ll impart to you a discovery I&rsquo;ve
made.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wallable; it&rsquo;s cost twelve thousand five
hundred pound; it may do you good in life&mdash;The secret of this matter
is, that it ain&rsquo;t so much that a person goes into Society, as
that Society goes into a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not exactly keepin up with his meanin, I shook my head, put on a
deep look, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Mr. Chops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, twitchin me by the leg, &ldquo;Society
has gone into me, to the tune of every penny of my property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that I went pale, and though nat&rsquo;rally a bold speaker,
I couldn&rsquo;t hardly say, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Normandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolted.&nbsp; With the plate,&rdquo; said Mr. Chops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And t&rsquo;other one?&rdquo; meaning him as formerly wore
the bishop&rsquo;s mitre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolted.&nbsp; With the jewels,&rdquo; said Mr. Chops.</p>
<p>I sat down and looked at him, and he stood up and looked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, and he seemed to myself to get wiser
as he got hoarser; &ldquo;Society, taken in the lump, is all dwarfs.&nbsp;
At the court of St. James&rsquo;s, they was all a doing my old business&mdash;all
a goin three times round the Cairawan, in the hold court-suits and properties.&nbsp;
Elsewheres, they was most of &rsquo;em ringin their little bells out
of make-believes.&nbsp; Everywheres, the sarser was a goin round.&nbsp;
Magsman, the sarser is the uniwersal Institution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I perceived, you understand, that he was soured by his misfortunes,
and I felt for Mr. Chops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to Fat Ladies,&rdquo; he says, giving his head a tremendious
one agin the wall, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s lots of <i>them</i> in Society,
and worse than the original.&nbsp; <i>Hers</i> was a outrage upon Taste&mdash;simply
a outrage upon Taste&mdash;awakenin contempt&mdash;carryin its own punishment
in the form of a Indian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he giv himself another tremendious
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;But <i>theirs</i>, Magsman, <i>theirs</i> is mercenary
outrages.&nbsp; Lay in Cashmeer shawls, buy bracelets, strew &rsquo;em
and a lot of &rsquo;andsome fans and things about your rooms, let it
be known that you give away like water to all as come to admire, and
the Fat Ladies that don&rsquo;t exhibit for so much down upon the drum,
will come from all the pints of the compass to flock about you, whatever
you are.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll drill holes in your &rsquo;art, Magsman,
like a Cullender.&nbsp; And when you&rsquo;ve no more left to give,
they&rsquo;ll laugh at you to your face, and leave you to have your
bones picked dry by Wulturs, like the dead Wild Ass of the Prairies
that you deserve to be!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he giv himself the most tremendious
one of all, and dropped.</p>
<p>I thought he was gone.&nbsp; His Ed was so heavy, and he knocked
it so hard, and he fell so stoney, and the sassagerial disturbance in
him must have been so immense, that I thought he was gone.&nbsp; But,
he soon come round with care, and he sat up on the floor, and he said
to me, with wisdom comin out of his eyes, if ever it come:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman!&nbsp; The most material difference between the two
states of existence through which your unhappy friend has passed;&rdquo;
he reached out his poor little hand, and his tears dropped down on the
moustachio which it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow,
but it is not in mortals to command success,&mdash;&ldquo;the difference
this.&nbsp; When I was out of Society, I was paid light for being seen.&nbsp;
When I went into Society, I paid heavy for being seen.&nbsp; I prefer
the former, even if I wasn&rsquo;t forced upon it.&nbsp; Give me out
through the trumpet, in the hold way, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arter that, he slid into the line again as easy as if he had been
iled all over.&nbsp; But the organ was kep from him, and no allusions
was ever made, when a company was in, to his property.&nbsp; He got
wiser every day; his views of Society and the Public was luminous, bewilderin,
awful; and his Ed got bigger and bigger as his Wisdom expanded it.</p>
<p>He took well, and pulled &rsquo;em in most excellent for nine weeks.&nbsp;
At the expiration of that period, when his Ed was a sight, he expressed
one evenin, the last Company havin been turned out, and the door shut,
a wish to have a little music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chops,&rdquo; I said (I never dropped the &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;
with him; the world might do it, but not me); &ldquo;Mr. Chops, are
you sure as you are in a state of mind and body to sit upon the organ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His answer was this: &ldquo;Toby, when next met with on the tramp,
I forgive her and the Indian.&nbsp; And I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with fear and trembling that I began to turn the handle; but
he sat like a lamb.&nbsp; I will be my belief to my dying day, that
I see his Ed expand as he sat; you may therefore judge how great his
thoughts was.&nbsp; He sat out all the changes, and then he come off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toby,&rdquo; he says, with a quiet smile, &ldquo;the little
man will now walk three times round the Cairawan, and retire behind
the curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we called him in the morning, we found him gone into a much
better Society than mine or Pall Mall&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I giv Mr. Chops
as comfortable a funeral as lay in my power, followed myself as Chief,
and had the George the Fourth canvass carried first, in the form of
a banner.&nbsp; But, the House was so dismal arterwards, that I giv
it up, and took to the Wan again.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t triumph,&rdquo; said Jarber, folding up the
second manuscript, and looking hard at Trottle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
triumph over this worthy creature.&nbsp; I merely ask him if he is satisfied
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he be anything else?&rdquo; I said, answering for
Trottle, who sat obstinately silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;This time, Jarber,
you have not only read us a delightfully amusing story, but you have
also answered the question about the House.&nbsp; Of course it stands
empty now.&nbsp; Who would think of taking it after it had been turned
into a caravan?&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked at Trottle, as I said those last
words, and Jarber waved his hand indulgently in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let this excellent person speak,&rdquo; said Jarber.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were about to say, my good man?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wished to ask, sir,&rdquo; said Trottle doggedly, &ldquo;if
you could kindly oblige me with a date or two in connection with that
last story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A date!&rdquo; repeated Jarber.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does the
man want with dates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to know, with great respect,&rdquo; persisted
Trottle, &ldquo;if the person named Magsman was the last tenant who
lived in the House.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my opinion&mdash;if I may be excused
for giving it&mdash;that he most decidedly was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With those words, Trottle made a low bow, and quietly left the room.</p>
<p>There is no denying that Jarber, when we were left together, looked
sadly discomposed.&nbsp; He had evidently forgotten to inquire about
dates; and, in spite of his magnificent talk about his series of discoveries,
it was quite as plain that the two stories he had just read, had really
and truly exhausted his present stock.&nbsp; I thought myself bound,
in common gratitude, to help him out of his embarrassment by a timely
suggestion.&nbsp; So I proposed that he should come to tea again, on
the next Monday evening, the thirteenth, and should make such inquiries
in the meantime, as might enable him to dispose triumphantly of Trottle&rsquo;s
objection.</p>
<p>He gallantly kissed my hand, made a neat little speech of acknowledgment,
and took his leave.&nbsp; For the rest of the week I would not encourage
Trottle by allowing him to refer to the House at all.&nbsp; I suspected
he was making his own inquiries about dates, but I put no questions
to him.</p>
<p>On Monday evening, the thirteenth, that dear unfortunate Jarber came,
punctual to the appointed time.&nbsp; He looked so terribly harassed,
that he was really quite a spectacle of feebleness and fatigue.&nbsp;
I saw, at a glance, that the question of dates had gone against him,
that Mr. Magsman had not been the last tenant of the House, and that
the reason of its emptiness was still to seek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I have gone through,&rdquo; said Jarber, &ldquo;words
are not eloquent enough to tell.&nbsp; O Sophonisba, I have begun another
series of discoveries!&nbsp; Accept the last two as stories laid on
your shrine; and wait to blame me for leaving your curiosity unappeased,
until you have heard Number Three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number Three looked like a very short manuscript, and I said as much.&nbsp;
Jarber explained to me that we were to have some poetry this time.&nbsp;
In the course of his investigations he had stepped into the Circulating
Library, to seek for information on the one important subject.&nbsp;
All the Library-people knew about the House was, that a female relative
of the last tenant, as they believed, had, just after that tenant left,
sent a little manuscript poem to them which she described as referring
to events that had actually passed in the House; and which she wanted
the proprietor of the Library to publish.&nbsp; She had written no address
on her letter; and the proprietor had kept the manuscript ready to be
given back to her (the publishing of poems not being in his line) when
she might call for it.&nbsp; She had never called for it; and the poem
had been lent to Jarber, at his express request, to read to me.</p>
<p>Before he began, I rang the bell for Trottle; being determined to
have him present at the new reading, as a wholesome check on his obstinacy.&nbsp;
To my surprise Peggy answered the bell, and told me, that Trottle had
stepped out without saying where.&nbsp; I instantly felt the strongest
possible conviction that he was at his old tricks: and that his stepping
out in the evening, without leave, meant&mdash;Philandering.</p>
<p>Controlling myself on my visitor&rsquo;s account, I dismissed Peggy,
stifled my indignation, and prepared, as politely as might be, to listen
to Jarber.</p>
<h2>THREE EVENINGS IN THE HOUSE</h2>
<h3>NUMBER ONE.</h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Yes, it look&rsquo;d dark and dreary<br />
That long and narrow street:<br />
Only the sound of the rain,<br />
And the tramp of passing feet,<br />
The duller glow of the fire,<br />
And gathering mists of night<br />
To mark how slow and weary<br />
The long day&rsquo;s cheerless flight!</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Watching the sullen fire,<br />
Hearing the dreary rain,<br />
Drop after drop, run down<br />
On the darkening window-pane;<br />
Chill was the heart of Bertha,<br />
Chill as that winter day,&mdash;<br />
For the star of her life had risen<br />
Only to fade away.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The voice that had been so strong<br />
To bid the snare depart,<br />
The true and earnest will,<br />
And the calm and steadfast heart,<br />
Were now weigh&rsquo;d down by sorrow,<br />
Were quivering now with pain;<br />
The clear path now seem&rsquo;d clouded,<br />
And all her grief in vain.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Duty, Right, Truth, who promised<br />
To help and save their own,<br />
Seem&rsquo;d spreading wide their pinions<br />
To leave her there alone.<br />
So, turning from the Present<br />
To well-known days of yore,<br />
She call&rsquo;d on them to strengthen<br />
And guard her soul once more.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>She thought how in her girlhood<br />
Her life was given away,<br />
The solemn promise spoken<br />
She kept so well to-day;<br />
How to her brother Herbert<br />
She had been help and guide,<br />
And how his artist-nature<br />
On her calm strength relied.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>How through life&rsquo;s fret and turmoil<br />
The passion and fire of art<br />
In him was soothed and quicken&rsquo;d<br />
By her true sister heart;<br />
How future hopes had always<br />
Been for his sake alone;<br />
And now, what strange new feeling<br />
Possess&rsquo;d her as its own?</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>Her home; each flower that breathed there;<br />
The wind&rsquo;s sigh, soft and low;<br />
Each trembling spray of ivy;<br />
The river&rsquo;s murmuring flow;<br />
The shadow of the forest;<br />
Sunset, or twilight dim;<br />
Dear as they were, were dearer<br />
By leaving them for him.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>And each year as it found her<br />
In the dull, feverish town,<br />
Saw self still more forgotten,<br />
And selfish care kept down<br />
By the calm joy of evening<br />
That brought him to her side,<br />
To warn him with wise counsel,<br />
Or praise with tender pride.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>Her heart, her life, her future,<br />
Her genius, only meant<br />
Another thing to give him,<br />
And be therewith content.<br />
To-day, what words had stirr&rsquo;d her,<br />
Her soul could not forget?<br />
What dream had fill&rsquo;d her spirit<br />
With strange and wild regret?</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>To leave him for another:<br />
Could it indeed be so?<br />
Could it have cost such anguish<br />
To bid this vision go?<br />
Was this her faith?&nbsp; Was Herbert<br />
The second in her heart?<br />
Did it need all this struggle<br />
To bid a dream depart?</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>And yet, within her spirit<br />
A far-off land was seen;<br />
A home, which might have held her;<br />
A love, which might have been;<br />
And Life: not the mere being<br />
Of daily ebb and flow,<br />
But Life itself had claim&rsquo;d her,<br />
And she had let it go!</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>Within her heart there echo&rsquo;d<br />
Again the well-known tune<br />
That promised this bright future,<br />
And ask&rsquo;d her for its own:<br />
Then words of sorrow, broken<br />
By half-reproachful pain;<br />
And then a farewell, spoken<br />
In words of cold disdain.</p>
<p>XIII.</p>
<p>Where now was the stern purpose<br />
That nerved her soul so long?<br />
Whence came the words she utter&rsquo;d,<br />
So hard, so cold, so strong?<br />
What right had she to banish<br />
A hope that God had given?<br />
Why must she choose earth&rsquo;s portion,<br />
And turn aside from Heaven?</p>
<p>XIV.</p>
<p>To-day!&nbsp; Was it this morning?<br />
If this long, fearful strife<br />
Was but the work of hours,<br />
What would be years of life?<br />
Why did a cruel Heaven<br />
For such great suffering call?<br />
And why&mdash;O, still more cruel!&mdash;<br />
Must her own words do all?</p>
<p>XV.</p>
<p>Did she repent?&nbsp; O Sorrow!<br />
Why do we linger still<br />
To take thy loving message,<br />
And do thy gentle will?<br />
See, her tears fall more slowly;<br />
The passionate murmurs cease,<br />
And back upon her spirit<br />
Flow strength, and love, and peace.</p>
<p>XVI.</p>
<p>The fire burns more brightly,<br />
The rain has passed away,<br />
Herbert will see no shadow<br />
Upon his home to-day;<br />
Only that Bertha greets him<br />
With doubly tender care,<br />
Kissing a fonder blessing<br />
Down on his golden hair.</p>
<h3>NUMBER TWO.</h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The studio is deserted,<br />
Palette and brush laid by,<br />
The sketch rests on the easel,<br />
The paint is scarcely dry;<br />
And Silence&mdash;who seems always<br />
Within her depths to bear<br />
The next sound that will utter&mdash;<br />
Now holds a dumb despair.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>So Bertha feels it: listening<br />
With breathless, stony fear,<br />
Waiting the dreadful summons<br />
Each minute brings more near:<br />
When the young life, now ebbing,<br />
Shall fail, and pass away<br />
Into that mighty shadow<br />
Who shrouds the house to-day.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>But why&mdash;when the sick chamber<br />
Is on the upper floor&mdash;<br />
Why dares not Bertha enter<br />
Within the close-shut door?<br />
If he&mdash;her all&mdash;her Brother,<br />
Lies dying in that gloom,<br />
What strange mysterious power<br />
Has sent her from the room?</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>It is not one week&rsquo;s anguish<br />
That can have changed her so;<br />
Joy has not died here lately,<br />
Struck down by one quick blow;<br />
But cruel months have needed<br />
Their long relentless chain,<br />
To teach that shrinking manner<br />
Of helpless, hopeless pain.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>The struggle was scarce over<br />
Last Christmas Eve had brought:<br />
The fibres still were quivering<br />
Of the one wounded thought,<br />
When Herbert&mdash;who, unconscious,<br />
Had guessed no inward strife&mdash;<br />
Bade her, in pride and pleasure,<br />
Welcome his fair young wife.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>Bade her rejoice, and smiling,<br />
Although his eyes were dim,<br />
Thank&rsquo;d God he thus could pay her<br />
The care she gave to him.<br />
This fresh bright life would bring her<br />
A new and joyous fate&mdash;<br />
O Bertha, check the murmur<br />
That cries, Too late! too late!</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>Too late!&nbsp; Could she have known it<br />
A few short weeks before,<br />
That his life was completed,<br />
And needing hers no more,<br />
She might&mdash;O sad repining!<br />
What &ldquo;might have been,&rdquo; forget;<br />
&ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; should suffice us<br />
To stifle vain regret.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>He needed her no longer,<br />
Each day it grew more plain;<br />
First with a startled wonder,<br />
Then with a wondering pain.<br />
Love: why, his wife best gave it;<br />
Comfort: durst Bertha speak?<br />
Counsel: when quick resentment<br />
Flush&rsquo;d on the young wife&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>No more long talks by firelight<br />
Of childish times long past,<br />
And dreams of future greatness<br />
Which he must reach at last;<br />
Dreams, where her purer instinct<br />
With truth unerring told<br />
Where was the worthless gilding,<br />
And where refin&egrave;d gold.</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>Slowly, but surely ever,<br />
Dora&rsquo;s poor jealous pride,<br />
Which she call&rsquo;d love for Herbert,<br />
Drove Bertha from his side;<br />
And, spite of nervous effort<br />
To share their alter&rsquo;d life,<br />
She felt a check to Herbert,<br />
A burden to his wife.</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>This was the least; for Bertha<br />
Fear&rsquo;d, dreaded, <i>knew</i> at length,<br />
How much his nature owed her<br />
Of truth, and power, and strength;<br />
And watch&rsquo;d the daily failing<br />
Of all his nobler part:<br />
Low aims, weak purpose, telling<br />
In lower, weaker art.</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>And now, when he is dying,<br />
The last words she could hear<br />
Must not be hers, but given<br />
The bride of one short year.<br />
The last care is another&rsquo;s;<br />
The last prayer must not be<br />
The one they learnt together<br />
Beside their mother&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>XIII.</p>
<p>Summon&rsquo;d at last: she kisses<br />
The clay-cold stiffening hand;<br />
And, reading pleading efforts<br />
To make her understand,<br />
Answers, with solemn promise,<br />
In clear but trembling tone,<br />
To Dora&rsquo;s life henceforward<br />
She will devote her own.</p>
<p>XIV.</p>
<p>Now all is over.&nbsp; Bertha<br />
Dares not remain to weep,<br />
But soothes the frightened Dora<br />
Into a sobbing sleep.<br />
The poor weak child will need her:<br />
O, who can dare complain,<br />
When God sends a new Duty<br />
To comfort each new Pain!</p>
<h3>NUMBER THREE.</h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The House is all deserted<br />
In the dim evening gloom,<br />
Only one figure passes<br />
Slowly from room to room;<br />
And, pausing at each doorway,<br />
Seems gathering up again<br />
Within her heart the relics<br />
Of bygone joy and pain.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>There is an earnest longing<br />
In those who onward gaze,<br />
Looking with weary patience<br />
Towards the coming days.<br />
There is a deeper longing,<br />
More sad, more strong, more keen:<br />
Those know it who look backward,<br />
And yearn for what has been.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>At every hearth she pauses,<br />
Touches each well-known chair;<br />
Gazes from every window,<br />
Lingers on every stair.<br />
What have these months brought Bertha<br />
Now one more year is past?<br />
This Christmas Eve shall tell us,<br />
The third one and the last.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The wilful, wayward Dora,<br />
In those first weeks of grief,<br />
Could seek and find in Bertha<br />
Strength, soothing, and relief.<br />
And Bertha&mdash;last sad comfort<br />
True woman-heart can take&mdash;<br />
Had something still to suffer<br />
And do for Herbert&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Spring, with her western breezes,<br />
From Indian islands bore<br />
To Bertha news that Leonard<br />
Would seek his home once more.<br />
What was it&mdash;joy, or sorrow?<br />
What were they&mdash;hopes, or fears?<br />
That flush&rsquo;d her cheeks with crimson,<br />
And fill&rsquo;d her eyes with tears?</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>He came.&nbsp; And who so kindly<br />
Could ask and hear her tell<br />
Herbert&rsquo;s last hours; for Leonard<br />
Had known and loved him well.<br />
Daily he came; and Bertha,<br />
Poor wear heart, at length,<br />
Weigh&rsquo;d down by other&rsquo;s weakness,<br />
Could rest upon his strength.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>Yet not the voice of Leonard<br />
Could her true care beguile,<br />
That turn&rsquo;d to watch, rejoicing,<br />
Dora&rsquo;s reviving smile.<br />
So, from that little household<br />
The worst gloom pass&rsquo;d away,<br />
The one bright hour of evening<br />
Lit up the livelong day.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>Days passed.&nbsp; The golden summer<br />
In sudden heat bore down<br />
Its blue, bright, glowing sweetness<br />
Upon the scorching town.<br />
And sights and sounds of country<br />
Came in the warm soft tune<br />
Sung by the honey&rsquo;d breezes<br />
Borne on the wings of June.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>One twilight hour, but earlier<br />
Than usual, Bertha thought<br />
She knew the fresh sweet fragrance<br />
Of flowers that Leonard brought;<br />
Through open&rsquo;d doors and windows<br />
It stole up through the gloom,<br />
And with appealing sweetness<br />
Drew Bertha from her room.</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>Yes, he was there; and pausing<br />
Just near the open&rsquo;d door,<br />
To check her heart&rsquo;s quick beating,<br />
She heard&mdash;and paused still more&mdash;<br />
His low voice Dora&rsquo;s answers&mdash;<br />
His pleading&mdash;Yes, she knew<br />
The tone&mdash;the words&mdash;the accents:<br />
She once had heard them too.</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would Bertha blame her?&rdquo;&nbsp; Leonard&rsquo;s<br />
Low, tender answer came:<br />
&ldquo;Bertha was far too noble<br />
To think or dream of blame.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And was he sure he loved her?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, with the one love given<br />
Once in a lifetime only,<br />
With one soul and one heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>Then came a plaintive murmur,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Dora had once been told<br />
That he and Bertha&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dearest,<br />
Bertha is far too cold<br />
To love; and I, my Dora,<br />
If once I fancied so,<br />
It was a brief delusion,<br />
And over,&mdash;long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>XIII.</p>
<p>Between the Past and Present,<br />
On that bleak moment&rsquo;s height,<br />
She stood.&nbsp; As some lost traveller<br />
By a quick flash of light<br />
Seeing a gulf before him,<br />
With dizzy, sick despair,<br />
Reels to clutch backward, but to find<br />
A deeper chasm there.</p>
<p>XIV.</p>
<p>The twilight grew still darker,<br />
The fragrant flowers more sweet,<br />
The stars shone out in heaven,<br />
The lamps gleam&rsquo;d down the street;<br />
And hours pass&rsquo;d in dreaming<br />
Over their new-found fate,<br />
Ere they could think of wondering<br />
Why Bertha was so late.</p>
<p>XV.</p>
<p>She came, and calmly listen&rsquo;d;<br />
In vain they strove to trace<br />
If Herbert&rsquo;s memory shadow&rsquo;d<br />
In grief upon her face.<br />
No blame, no wonder show&rsquo;d there,<br />
No feeling could be told;<br />
Her voice was not less steady,<br />
Her manner not more cold.</p>
<p>XVI.</p>
<p>They could not hear the anguish<br />
That broke in words of pain<br />
Through that calm summer midnight,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;My Herbert&mdash;mine again!&rdquo;<br />
Yes, they have once been parted,<br />
But this day shall restore<br />
The long lost one: she claims him:<br />
&ldquo;My Herbert&mdash;mine once more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>XVII.</p>
<p>Now Christmas Eve returning,<br />
Saw Bertha stand beside<br />
The altar, greeting Dora,<br />
Again a smiling bride;<br />
And now the gloomy evening<br />
Sees Bertha pale and worn,<br />
Leaving the house for ever,<br />
To wander out forlorn.</p>
<p>XVIII.</p>
<p>Forlorn&mdash;nay, not so.&nbsp; Anguish<br />
Shall do its work at length;<br />
Her soul, pass&rsquo;d through the fire,<br />
Shall gain still purer strength.<br />
Somewhere there waits for Bertha<br />
An earnest noble part;<br />
And, meanwhile, God is with her,&mdash;<br />
God, and her own true heart!</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>I could warmly and sincerely praise the little poem, when Jarber
had done reading it; but I could not say that it tended in any degree
towards clearing up the mystery of the empty House.</p>
<p>Whether it was the absence of the irritating influence of Trottle,
or whether it was simply fatigue, I cannot say, but Jarber did not strike
me, that evening, as being in his usual spirits.&nbsp; And though he
declared that he was not in the least daunted by his want of success
thus far, and that he was resolutely determined to make more discoveries,
he spoke in a languid absent manner, and shortly afterwards took his
leave at rather an early hour.</p>
<p>When Trottle came back, and when I indignantly taxed him with Philandering,
he not only denied the imputation, but asserted that he had been employed
on my service, and, in consideration of that, boldly asked for leave
of absence for two days, and for a morning to himself afterwards, to
complete the business, in which he solemnly declared that I was interested.&nbsp;
In remembrance of his long and faithful service to me, I did violence
to myself, and granted his request.&nbsp; And he, on his side, engaged
to explain himself to my satisfaction, in a week&rsquo;s time, on Monday
evening the twentieth.</p>
<p>A day or two before, I sent to Jarber&rsquo;s lodgings to ask him
to drop in to tea.&nbsp; His landlady sent back an apology for him that
made my hair stand on end.&nbsp; His feet were in hot water; his head
was in a flannel petticoat; a green shade was over his eyes; the rheumatism
was in his legs; and a mustard-poultice was on his chest.&nbsp; He was
also a little feverish, and rather distracted in his mind about Manchester
Marriages, a Dwarf, and Three Evenings, or Evening Parties&mdash;his
landlady was not sure which&mdash;in an empty House, with the Water
Rate unpaid.</p>
<p>Under these distressing circumstances, I was necessarily left alone
with Trottle.&nbsp; His promised explanation began, like Jarber&rsquo;s
discoveries, with the reading of a written paper.&nbsp; The only difference
was that Trottle introduced his manuscript under the name of a Report.</p>
<h2>TROTTLE&rsquo;S REPORT</h2>
<p>The curious events related in these pages would, many of them, most
likely never have happened, if a person named Trottle had not presumed,
contrary to his usual custom, to think for himself.</p>
<p>The subject on which the person in question had ventured, for the
first time in his life, to form an opinion purely and entirely his own,
was one which had already excited the interest of his respected mistress
in a very extraordinary degree.&nbsp; Or, to put it in plainer terms
still, the subject was no other than the mystery of the empty House.</p>
<p>Feeling no sort of objection to set a success of his own, if possible,
side by side with a failure of Mr. Jarber&rsquo;s, Trottle made up his
mind, one Monday evening, to try what he could do, on his own account,
towards clearing up the mystery of the empty House.&nbsp; Carefully
dismissing from his mind all nonsensical notions of former tenants and
their histories, and keeping the one point in view steadily before him,
he started to reach it in the shortest way, by walking straight up to
the House, and bringing himself face to face with the first person in
it who opened the door to him.</p>
<p>It was getting towards dark, on Monday evening, the thirteenth of
the month, when Trottle first set foot on the steps of the House.&nbsp;
When he knocked at the door, he knew nothing of the matter which he
was about to investigate, except that the landlord was an elderly widower
of good fortune, and that his name was Forley.&nbsp; A small beginning
enough for a man to start from, certainly!</p>
<p>On dropping the knocker, his first proceeding was to look down cautiously
out of the corner of his right eye, for any results which might show
themselves at the kitchen-window.&nbsp; There appeared at it immediately
the figure of a woman, who looked up inquisitively at the stranger on
the steps, left the window in a hurry, and came back to it with an open
letter in her hand, which she held up to the fading light.&nbsp; After
looking over the letter hastily for a moment or so, the woman disappeared
once more.</p>
<p>Trottle next heard footsteps shuffling and scraping along the bare
hall of the house.&nbsp; On a sudden they ceased, and the sound of two
voices&mdash;a shrill persuading voice and a gruff resisting voice&mdash;confusedly
reached his ears.&nbsp; After a while, the voices left off speaking&mdash;a
chain was undone, a bolt drawn back&mdash;the door opened&mdash;and
Trottle stood face to face with two persons, a woman in advance, and
a man behind her, leaning back flat against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you good evening, sir,&rdquo; says the woman, in such
a sudden way, and in such a cracked voice, that it was quite startling
to hear her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chilly weather, ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&nbsp;
Please to walk in.&nbsp; You come from good Mr. Forley, don&rsquo;t
you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo; chimes in the man hoarsely, making
a sort of gruff echo of himself, and chuckling after it, as if he thought
he had made a joke.</p>
<p>If Trottle had said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the door would have been probably
closed in his face.&nbsp; Therefore, he took circumstances as he found
them, and boldly ran all the risk, whatever it might be, of saying,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right sir,&rdquo; says the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
Mr. Forley&rsquo;s letter told us his particular friend would be here
to represent him, at dusk, on Monday the thirteenth&mdash;or, if not
on Monday the thirteenth, then on Monday the twentieth, at the same
time, without fail.&nbsp; And here you are on Monday the thirteenth,
ain&rsquo;t you, sir?&nbsp; Mr. Forley&rsquo;s particular friend, and
dressed all in black&mdash;quite right, sir!&nbsp; Please to step into
the dining-room&mdash;it&rsquo;s always kep scoured and clean against
Mr. Forley comes here&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll fetch a candle in half a
minute.&nbsp; It gets so dark in the evenings, now, you hardly know
where you are, do you, sir?&nbsp; And how is good Mr. Forley in his
health?&nbsp; We trust he is better, Benjamin, don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp;
We are so sorry not to see him as usual, Benjamin, ain&rsquo;t we?&nbsp;
In half a minute, sir, if you don&rsquo;t mind waiting, I&rsquo;ll be
back with the candle.&nbsp; Come along, Benjamin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Benjamin,&rdquo; chimes in the echo, and chuckles
again as if he thought he had made another joke.</p>
<p>Left alone in the empty front-parlour, Trottle wondered what was
coming next, as he heard the shuffling, scraping footsteps go slowly
down the kitchen-stairs.&nbsp; The front-door had been carefully chained
up and bolted behind him on his entrance; and there was not the least
chance of his being able to open it to effect his escape, without betraying
himself by making a noise.</p>
<p>Not being of the Jarber sort, luckily for himself, he took his situation
quietly, as he found it, and turned his time, while alone, to account,
by summing up in his own mind the few particulars which he had discovered
thus far.&nbsp; He had found out, first, that Mr. Forley was in the
habit of visiting the house regularly.&nbsp; Second, that Mr. Forley
being prevented by illness from seeing the people put in charge as usual,
had appointed a friend to represent him; and had written to say so.&nbsp;
Third, that the friend had a choice of two Mondays, at a particular
time in the evening, for doing his errand; and that Trottle had accidentally
hit on this time, and on the first of the Mondays, for beginning his
own investigations.&nbsp; Fourth, that the similarity between Trottle&rsquo;s
black dress, as servant out of livery, and the dress of the messenger
(whoever he might be), had helped the error by which Trottle was profiting.&nbsp;
So far, so good.&nbsp; But what was the messenger&rsquo;s errand? and
what chance was there that he might not come up and knock at the door
himself, from minute to minute, on that very evening?</p>
<p>While Trottle was turning over this last consideration in his mind,
he heard the shuffling footsteps come up the stairs again, with a flash
of candle-light going before them.&nbsp; He waited for the woman&rsquo;s
coming in with some little anxiety; for the twilight had been too dim
on his getting into the house to allow him to see either her face or
the man&rsquo;s face at all clearly.</p>
<p>The woman came in first, with the man she called Benjamin at her
heels, and set the candle on the mantel-piece.&nbsp; Trottle takes leave
to describe her as an offensively-cheerful old woman, awfully lean and
wiry, and sharp all over, at eyes, nose, and chin&mdash;devilishly brisk,
smiling, and restless, with a dirty false front and a dirty black cap,
and short fidgetty arms, and long hooked finger-nails&mdash;an unnaturally
lusty old woman, who walked with a spring in her wicked old feet, and
spoke with a smirk on her wicked old face&mdash;the sort of old woman
(as Trottle thinks) who ought to have lived in the dark ages, and been
ducked in a horse-pond, instead of flourishing in the nineteenth century,
and taking charge of a Christian house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll please to excuse my son, Benjamin, won&rsquo;t
you, sir?&rdquo; says this witch without a broomstick, pointing to the
man behind her, propped against the bare wall of the dining-room, exactly
as he had been propped against the bare wall of the passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
got his inside dreadful bad again, has my son Benjamin.&nbsp; And he
won&rsquo;t go to bed, and he will follow me about the house, up-stairs
and downstairs, and in my lady&rsquo;s chamber, as the song says, you
know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s his indisgestion, poor dear, that sours his temper
and makes him so agravating&mdash;and indisgestion is a wearing thing
to the best of us, ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo; chimes in agravating Benjamin,
winking at the candle-light like an owl at the sunshine.</p>
<p>Trottle examined the man curiously, while his horrid old mother was
speaking of him.&nbsp; He found &ldquo;My son Benjamin&rdquo; to be
little and lean, and buttoned-up slovenly in a frowsy old great-coat
that fell down to his ragged carpet-slippers.&nbsp; His eyes were very
watery, his cheeks very pale, and his lips very red.&nbsp; His breathing
was so uncommonly loud, that it sounded almost like a snore.&nbsp; His
head rolled helplessly in the monstrous big collar of his great-coat;
and his limp, lazy hands pottered about the wall on either side of him,
as if they were groping for a imaginary bottle.&nbsp; In plain English,
the complaint of &ldquo;My son Benjamin&rdquo; was drunkenness, of the
stupid, pig-headed, sottish kind.&nbsp; Drawing this conclusion easily
enough, after a moment&rsquo;s observation of the man, Trottle found
himself, nevertheless, keeping his eyes fixed much longer than was necessary
on the ugly drunken face rolling about in the monstrous big coat collar,
and looking at it with a curiosity that he could hardly account for
at first.&nbsp; Was there something familiar to him in the man&rsquo;s
features?&nbsp; He turned away from them for an instant, and then turned
back to him again.&nbsp; After that second look, the notion forced itself
into his mind, that he had certainly seen a face somewhere, of which
that sot&rsquo;s face appeared like a kind of slovenly copy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
thinks he to himself, &ldquo;where did I last see the man whom this
agravating Benjamin, here, so very strongly reminds me of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no time, just then&mdash;with the cheerful old woman&rsquo;s
eye searching him all over, and the cheerful old woman&rsquo;s tongue
talking at him, nineteen to the dozen&mdash;for Trottle to be ransacking
his memory for small matters that had got into wrong corners of it.&nbsp;
He put by in his mind that very curious circumstance respecting Benjamin&rsquo;s
face, to be taken up again when a fit opportunity offered itself; and
kept his wits about him in prime order for present necessities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like to go down into the kitchen, would
you?&rdquo; says the witch without the broomstick, as familiar as if
she had been Trottle&rsquo;s mother, instead of Benjamin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bit of fire in the grate, and the sink in the
back kitchen don&rsquo;t smell to matter much to-day, and it&rsquo;s
uncommon chilly up here when a person&rsquo;s flesh don&rsquo;t hardly
cover a person&rsquo;s bones.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t look cold, sir,
do you?&nbsp; And then, why, Lord bless my soul, our little bit of business
is so very, very little, it&rsquo;s hardly worth while to go downstairs
about it, after all.&nbsp; Quite a game at business, ain&rsquo;t it,
sir?&nbsp; Give-and-take that&rsquo;s what I call it&mdash;give-and-take!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, her wicked old eyes settled hungrily on the region round
about Trottle&rsquo;s waistcoat-pocket, and she began to chuckle like
her son, holding out one of her skinny hands, and tapping cheerfully
in the palm with the knuckles of the other.&nbsp; Agravating Benjamin,
seeing what she was about, roused up a little, chuckled and tapped in
imitation of her, got an idea of his own into his muddled head all of
a sudden, and bolted it out charitably for the benefit of Trottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; says Benjamin, settling himself against the
wall and nodding his head viciously at his cheerful old mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I say!&nbsp; Look out.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll skin you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assisted by these signs and warnings, Trottle found no difficulty
in understanding that the business referred to was the giving and taking
of money, and that he was expected to be the giver.&nbsp; It was at
this stage of the proceedings that he first felt decidedly uncomfortable,
and more than half inclined to wish he was on the street-side of the
house-door again.</p>
<p>He was still cudgelling his brains for an excuse to save his pocket,
when the silence was suddenly interrupted by a sound in the upper part
of the house.</p>
<p>It was not at all loud&mdash;it was a quiet, still, scraping sound&mdash;so
faint that it could hardly have reached the quickest ears, except in
an empty house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, Benjamin?&rdquo; says the old woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at it again, even in the dark, ain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp;
P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;d like to see him, sir!&rdquo; says she, turning
on Trottle, and poking her grinning face close to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only
name it; only say if you&rsquo;d like to see him before we do our little
bit of business&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll show good Forley&rsquo;s friend
up-stairs, just as if he was good Mr. Forley himself.&nbsp; <i>My</i>
legs are all right, whatever Benjamin&rsquo;s may be.&nbsp; I get younger
and younger, and stronger and stronger, and jollier and jollier, every
day&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I do!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind the stairs
on my account, sir, if you&rsquo;d like to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo; Trottle wondered whether &ldquo;him&rdquo; meant
a man, or a boy, or a domestic animal of the male species.&nbsp; Whatever
it meant, here was a chance of putting off that uncomfortable give-and-take-business,
and, better still, a chance perhaps of finding out one of the secrets
of the mysterious House.&nbsp; Trottle&rsquo;s spirits began to rise
again and he said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; directly, with the confidence of
a man who knew all about it.</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s mother took the candle at once, and lighted Trottle
briskly to the stairs; and Benjamin himself tried to follow as usual.&nbsp;
But getting up several flights of stairs, even helped by the bannisters,
was more, with his particular complaint, than he seemed to feel himself
inclined to venture on.&nbsp; He sat down obstinately on the lowest
step, with his head against the wall, and the tails of his big great-coat
spreading out magnificently on the stairs behind him and above him,
like a dirty imitation of a court lady&rsquo;s train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit there, dear,&rdquo; says his affectionate
mother, stopping to snuff the candle on the first landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall sit here,&rdquo; says Benjamin, agravating to the
last, &ldquo;till the milk comes in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cheerful old woman went on nimbly up the stairs to the first
floor, and Trottle followed, with his eyes and ears wide open.&nbsp;
He had seen nothing out of the common in the front-parlour, or up the
staircase, so far.&nbsp; The House was dirty and dreary and close-smelling&mdash;but
there was nothing about it to excite the least curiosity, except the
faint scraping sound, which was now beginning to get a little clearer&mdash;though
still not at all loud&mdash;as Trottle followed his leader up the stairs
to the second floor.</p>
<p>Nothing on the second-floor landing, but cobwebs above and bits of
broken plaster below, cracked off from the ceiling.&nbsp; Benjamin&rsquo;s
mother was not a bit out of breath, and looked all ready to go to the
top of the monument if necessary.&nbsp; The faint scraping sound had
got a little clearer still; but Trottle was no nearer to guessing what
it might be, than when he first heard it in the parlour downstairs.</p>
<p>On the third, and last, floor, there were two doors; one, which was
shut, leading into the front garret; and one, which was ajar, leading
into the back garret.&nbsp; There was a loft in the ceiling above the
landing; but the cobwebs all over it vouched sufficiently for its not
having been opened for some little time.&nbsp; The scraping noise, plainer
than ever here, sounded on the other side of the back garret door; and,
to Trottle&rsquo;s great relief, that was precisely the door which the
cheerful old woman now pushed open.</p>
<p>Trottle followed her in; and, for once in his life, at any rate,
was struck dumb with amazement, at the sight which the inside of the
room revealed to him.</p>
<p>The garret was absolutely empty of everything in the shape of furniture.&nbsp;
It must have been used at one time or other, by somebody engaged in
a profession or a trade which required for the practice of it a great
deal of light; for the one window in the room, which looked out on a
wide open space at the back of the house, was three or four times as
large, every way, as a garret-window usually is.&nbsp; Close under this
window, kneeling on the bare boards with his face to the door, there
appeared, of all the creatures in the world to see alone at such a place
and at such a time, a mere mite of a child&mdash;a little, lonely, wizen,
strangely-clad boy, who could not at the most, have been more than five
years old.&nbsp; He had a greasy old blue shawl crossed over his breast,
and rolled up, to keep the ends from the ground, into a great big lump
on his back.&nbsp; A strip of something which looked like the remains
of a woman&rsquo;s flannel petticoat, showed itself under the shawl,
and, below that again, a pair of rusty black stockings, worlds too large
for him, covered his legs and his shoeless feet.&nbsp; A pair of old
clumsy muffetees, which had worked themselves up on his little frail
red arms to the elbows, and a big cotton nightcap that had dropped down
to his very eyebrows, finished off the strange dress which the poor
little man seemed not half big enough to fill out, and not near strong
enough to walk about in.</p>
<p>But there was something to see even more extraordinary than the clothes
the child was swaddled up in, and that was the game which he was playing
at, all by himself; and which, moreover, explained in the most unexpected
manner the faint scraping noise that had found its way down-stairs,
through the half-opened door, in the silence of the empty house.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that the child was on his knees in the garret,
when Trottle first saw him.&nbsp; He was not saying his prayers, and
not crouching down in terror at being alone in the dark.&nbsp; He was,
odd and unaccountable as it may appear, doing nothing more or less than
playing at a charwoman&rsquo;s or housemaid&rsquo;s business of scouring
the floor.&nbsp; Both his little hands had tight hold of a mangy old
blacking-brush, with hardly any bristles left in it, which he was rubbing
backwards and forwards on the boards, as gravely and steadily as if
he had been at scouring-work for years, and had got a large family to
keep by it.&nbsp; The coming-in of Trottle and the old woman did not
startle or disturb him in the least.&nbsp; He just looked up for a minute
at the candle, with a pair of very bright, sharp eyes, and then went
on with his work again, as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; On one side
of him was a battered pint saucepan without a handle, which was his
make-believe pail; and on the other a morsel of slate-coloured cotton
rag, which stood for his flannel to wipe up with.&nbsp; After scrubbing
bravely for a minute or two, he took the bit of rag, and mopped up,
and then squeezed make-believe water out into his make-believe pail,
as grave as any judge that ever sat on a Bench.&nbsp; By the time he
thought he had got the floor pretty dry, he raised himself upright on
his knees, and blew out a good long breath, and set his little red arms
akimbo, and nodded at Trottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; says the child, knitting his little downy eyebrows
into a frown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drat the dirt!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve cleaned up.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my beer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s mother chuckled till Trottle thought she would have
choked herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord ha&rsquo; mercy on us!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;just hear
the imp.&nbsp; You would never think he was only five years old, would
you, sir?&nbsp; Please to tell good Mr. Forley you saw him going on
as nicely as ever, playing at being me scouring the parlour floor, and
calling for my beer afterwards.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s his regular game,
morning, noon, and night&mdash;he&rsquo;s never tired of it.&nbsp; Only
look how snug we&rsquo;ve been and dressed him.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
shawl a keepin his precious little body warm, and Benjamin&rsquo;s nightcap
a keepin his precious little head warm, and Benjamin&rsquo;s stockings,
drawed over his trowsers, a keepin his precious little legs warm.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s snug and happy if ever a imp was yet.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s
my beer!&rsquo;&mdash;say it again, little dear, say it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Trottle had seen the boy, with a light and a fire in the room,
clothed like other children, and playing naturally with a top, or a
box of soldiers, or a bouncing big India-rubber ball, he might have
been as cheerful under the circumstances as Benjamin&rsquo;s mother
herself.&nbsp; But seeing the child reduced (as he could not help suspecting)
for want of proper toys and proper child&rsquo;s company, to take up
with the mocking of an old woman at her scouring-work, for something
to stand in the place of a game, Trottle, though not a family man, nevertheless
felt the sight before him to be, in its way, one of the saddest and
the most pitiable that he had ever witnessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my man,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the boldest
little chap in all England.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t seem a bit afraid
of being up here all by yourself in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big winder,&rdquo; says the child, pointing up to it,
&ldquo;sees in the dark; and I see with the big winder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He stops a bit, and gets up on his legs, and looks hard at Benjamin&rsquo;s
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good &rsquo;un,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t
I?&nbsp; I save candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trottle wondered what else the forlorn little creature had been brought
up to do without, besides candle-light; and risked putting a question
as to whether he ever got a run in the open air to cheer him up a bit.&nbsp;
O, yes, he had a run now and then, out of doors (to say nothing of his
runs about the house), the lively little cricket&mdash;a run according
to good Mr. Forley&rsquo;s instructions, which were followed out carefully,
as good Mr. Forley&rsquo;s friend would be glad to hear, to the very
letter.</p>
<p>As Trottle could only have made one reply to this, namely, that good
Mr. Forley&rsquo;s instructions were, in his opinion, the instructions
of an infernal scamp; and as he felt that such an answer would naturally
prove the death-blow to all further discoveries on his part, he gulped
down his feelings before they got too many for him, and held his tongue,
and looked round towards the window again to see what the forlorn little
boy was going to amuse himself with next.</p>
<p>The child had gathered up his blacking-brush and bit of rag, and
had put them into the old tin saucepan; and was now working his way,
as well as his clothes would let him, with his make-believe pail hugged
up in his arms, towards a door of communication which led from the back
to the front garret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; says he, looking round sharply over his shoulder,
&ldquo;what are you two stopping here for?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to
bed now&mdash;and so I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he opened the door, and walked into the front room.&nbsp;
Seeing Trottle take a step or two to follow him, Benjamin&rsquo;s mother
opened her wicked old eyes in a state of great astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you seen
enough of him yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Trottle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to see
him go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s mother burst into such a fit of chuckling that the
loose extinguisher in the candlestick clattered again with the shaking
of her hand.&nbsp; To think of good Mr. Forley&rsquo;s friend taking
ten times more trouble about the imp than good Mr. Forley himself!&nbsp;
Such a joke as that, Benjamin&rsquo;s mother had not often met with
in the course of her life, and she begged to be excused if she took
the liberty of having a laugh at it.</p>
<p>Leaving her to laugh as much as she pleased, and coming to a pretty
positive conclusion, after what he had just heard, that Mr. Forley&rsquo;s
interest in the child was not of the fondest possible kind, Trottle
walked into the front room, and Benjamin&rsquo;s mother, enjoying herself
immensely, followed with the candle.</p>
<p>There were two pieces of furniture in the front garret.&nbsp; One,
an old stool of the sort that is used to stand a cask of beer on; and
the other a great big ricketty straddling old truckle bedstead.&nbsp;
In the middle of this bedstead, surrounded by a dim brown waste of sacking,
was a kind of little island of poor bedding&mdash;an old bolster, with
nearly all the feathers out of it, doubled in three for a pillow; a
mere shred of patchwork counter-pane, and a blanket; and under that,
and peeping out a little on either side beyond the loose clothes, two
faded chair cushions of horsehair, laid along together for a sort of
makeshift mattress.&nbsp; When Trottle got into the room, the lonely
little boy had scrambled up on the bedstead with the help of the beer-stool,
and was kneeling on the outer rim of sacking with the shred of counterpane
in his hands, just making ready to tuck it in for himself under the
chair cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tuck you up, my man,&rdquo; says Trottle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jump into bed, and let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to tuck myself up,&rdquo; says the poor forlorn child,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t mean to jump.&nbsp; I mean to crawl, I do&mdash;and
so I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he set to work, tucking in the clothes tight all down
the sides of the cushions, but leaving them open at the foot.&nbsp;
Then, getting up on his knees, and looking hard at Trottle as much as
to say, &ldquo;What do you mean by offering to help such a handy little
chap as me?&rdquo; he began to untie the big shawl for himself, and
did it, too, in less than half a minute.&nbsp; Then, doubling the shawl
up loose over the foot of the bed, he says, &ldquo;I say, look here,&rdquo;
and ducks under the clothes, head first, worming his way up and up softly,
under the blanket and counterpane, till Trottle saw the top of the large
nightcap slowly peep out on the bolster.&nbsp; This over-sized head-gear
of the child&rsquo;s had so shoved itself down in the course of his
journey to the pillow, under the clothes, that when he got his face
fairly out on the bolster, he was all nightcap down to his mouth.&nbsp;
He soon freed himself, however, from this slight encumbrance by turning
the ends of the cap up gravely to their old place over his eyebrows&mdash;looked
at Trottle&mdash;said, &ldquo;Snug, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Good-bye!&rdquo;&mdash;popped
his face under the clothes again&mdash;and left nothing to be seen of
him but the empty peak of the big nightcap standing up sturdily on end
in the middle of the bolster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a young limb it is, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; says Benjamin&rsquo;s
mother, giving Trottle a cheerful dig with her elbow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
on! you won&rsquo;t see no more of him to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I tell you!&rdquo; sings out a shrill, little voice
under the bedclothes, chiming in with a playful finish to the old woman&rsquo;s
last words.</p>
<p>If Trottle had not been, by this time, positively resolved to follow
the wicked secret which accident had mixed him up with, through all
its turnings and windings, right on to the end, he would have probably
snatched the boy up then and there, and carried him off from his garret
prison, bed-clothes and all.&nbsp; As it was, he put a strong check
on himself, kept his eye on future possibilities, and allowed Benjamin&rsquo;s
mother to lead him down-stairs again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind them top bannisters,&rdquo; says she, as Trottle laid
his hand on them.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are as rotten as medlars every one
of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people come to see the premises,&rdquo; says Trottle,
trying to feel his way a little farther into the mystery of the House,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t bring many of them up here, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart alive!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;nobody ever
comes now.&nbsp; The outside of the house is quite enough to warn them
off.&nbsp; Mores the pity, as I say.&nbsp; It used to keep me in spirits,
staggering &rsquo;em all, one after another, with the frightful high
rent&mdash;specially the women, drat &rsquo;em.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
the rent of this house?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hundred and twenty pound
a-year!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hundred and twenty? why, there ain&rsquo;t
a house in the street as lets for more than eighty!&rsquo;&mdash;Likely
enough, ma&rsquo;am; other landlords may lower their rents if they please;
but this here landlord sticks to his rights, and means to have as much
for his house as his father had before him!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;But
the neighbourhood&rsquo;s gone off since then!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hundred
and twenty pound, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The landlord must
be mad!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hundred and twenty pound, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Open
the door you impertinent woman!&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord! what a happiness
it was to see &rsquo;em bounce out, with that awful rent a-ringing in
their ears all down the street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped on the second-floor landing to treat herself to another
chuckle, while Trottle privately posted up in his memory what he had
just heard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two points made out,&rdquo; he thought to himself:
&ldquo;the house is kept empty on purpose, and the way it&rsquo;s done
is to ask a rent that nobody will pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, deary me!&rdquo; says Benjamin&rsquo;s mother, changing
the subject on a sudden, and twisting back with a horrid, greedy quickness
to those awkward money-matters which she had broached down in the parlour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve done, one way and another for Mr. Forley, it
isn&rsquo;t in words to tell!&nbsp; That nice little bit of business
of ours ought to be a bigger bit of business, considering the trouble
we take, Benjamin and me, to make the imp upstairs as happy as the day
is long.&nbsp; If good Mr. Forley would only please to think a little
more of what a deal he owes to Benjamin and me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; says Trottle, catching her up
short in desperation, and seeing his way, by the help of those last
words of hers, to slipping cleverly through her fingers.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
should you say, if I told you that Mr. Forley was nothing like so far
from thinking about that little matter as you fancy?&nbsp; You would
be disappointed, now, if I told you that I had come to-day without the
money?&rdquo;&mdash;(her lank old jaw fell, and her villainous old eyes
glared, in a perfect state of panic, at that!)&mdash;&ldquo;But what
should you say, if I told you that Mr. Forley was only waiting for my
report, to send me here next Monday, at dusk, with a bigger bit of business
for us two to do together than ever you think for?&nbsp; What should
you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old wretch came so near to Trottle, before she answered, and
jammed him up confidentially so close into the corner of the landing,
that his throat, in a manner, rose at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you count it off, do you think, on more than that?&rdquo;
says she, holding up her four skinny fingers and her long crooked thumb,
all of a tremble, right before his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to two hands, instead of one?&rdquo; says
he, pushing past her, and getting down-stairs as fast as he could.</p>
<p>What she said Trottle thinks it best not to report, seeing that the
old hypocrite, getting next door to light-headed at the golden prospect
before her, took such liberties with unearthly names and persons which
ought never to have approached her lips, and rained down such an awful
shower of blessings on Trottle&rsquo;s head, that his hair almost stood
on end to hear her.&nbsp; He went on down-stairs as fast as his feet
would carry him, till he was brought up all standing, as the sailors
say, on the last flight, by agravating Benjamin, lying right across
the stair, and fallen off, as might have been expected, into a heavy
drunken sleep.</p>
<p>The sight of him instantly reminded Trottle of the curious half likeness
which he had already detected between the face of Benjamin and the face
of another man, whom he had seen at a past time in very different circumstances.&nbsp;
He determined, before leaving the House, to have one more look at the
wretched muddled creature; and accordingly shook him up smartly, and
propped him against the staircase wall, before his mother could interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to me; I&rsquo;ll freshen him up,&rdquo; says Trottle
to the old woman, looking hard in Benjamin&rsquo;s face, while he spoke.</p>
<p>The fright and surprise of being suddenly woke up, seemed, for about
a quarter of a minute, to sober the creature.&nbsp; When he first opened
his eyes, there was a new look in them for a moment, which struck home
to Trottle&rsquo;s memory as quick and as clear as a flash of light.&nbsp;
The old maudlin sleepy expression came back again in another instant,
and blurred out all further signs and tokens of the past.&nbsp; But
Trottle had seen enough in the moment before it came; and he troubled
Benjamin&rsquo;s face with no more inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Monday, at dusk,&rdquo; says he, cutting short some more
of the old woman&rsquo;s palaver about Benjamin&rsquo;s indisgestion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no more time to spare, ma&rsquo;am, to-night:
please to let me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a few last blessings, a few last dutiful messages to good Mr.
Forley, and a few last friendly hints not to forget next Monday at dusk,
Trottle contrived to struggle through the sickening business of leave-taking;
to get the door opened; and to find himself, to his own indescribable
relief, once more on the outer side of the House To Let.</p>
<h2>LET AT LAST</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said Trottle, folding up the manuscript
from which he had been reading, and setting it down with a smart tap
of triumph on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I venture to ask what you
think of that plain statement, as a guess on my part (and not on Mr.
Jarber&rsquo;s) at the riddle of the empty House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute or two I was unable to say a word.&nbsp; When I recovered
a little, my first question referred to the poor forlorn little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day is Monday the twentieth,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely
you have not let a whole week go by without trying to find out something
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except at bed-time, and meals, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered
Trottle, &ldquo;I have not let an hour go by.&nbsp; Please to understand
that I have only come to an end of what I have written, and not to an
end of what I have done.&nbsp; I wrote down those first particulars,
ma&rsquo;am, because they are of great importance, and also because
I was determined to come forward with my written documents, seeing that
Mr. Jarber chose to come forward, in the first instance, with his.&nbsp;
I am now ready to go on with the second part of my story as shortly
and plainly as possible, by word of mouth.&nbsp; The first thing I must
clear up, if you please, is the matter of Mr. Forley&rsquo;s family
affairs.&nbsp; I have heard you speak of them, ma&rsquo;am, at various
times; and I have understood that Mr. Forley had two children only by
his deceased wife, both daughters.&nbsp; The eldest daughter married,
to her father&rsquo;s entire satisfaction, one Mr. Bayne, a rich man,
holding a high government situation in Canada.&nbsp; She is now living
there with her husband, and her only child, a little girl of eight or
nine years old.&nbsp; Right so far, I think, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second daughter,&rdquo; Trottle went on, &ldquo;and Mr.
Forley&rsquo;s favourite, set her father&rsquo;s wishes and the opinions
of the world at flat defiance, by running away with a man of low origin&mdash;a
mate of a merchant-vessel, named Kirkland.&nbsp; Mr. Forley not only
never forgave that marriage, but vowed that he would visit the scandal
of it heavily in the future on husband and wife.&nbsp; Both escaped
his vengeance, whatever he meant it to be.&nbsp; The husband was drowned
on his first voyage after his marriage, and the wife died in child-bed.&nbsp;
Right again, I believe, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having got the family matter all right, we will now go back,
ma&rsquo;am, to me and my doings.&nbsp; Last Monday, I asked you for
leave of absence for two days; I employed the time in clearing up the
matter of Benjamin&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Last Saturday I was out of the
way when you wanted me.&nbsp; I played truant, ma&rsquo;am, on that
occasion, in company with a friend of mine, who is managing clerk in
a lawyer&rsquo;s office; and we both spent the morning at Doctors&rsquo;
Commons, over the last will and testament of Mr. Forley&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;
Leaving the will-business for a moment, please to follow me first, if
you have no objection, into the ugly subject of Benjamin&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
About six or seven years ago (thanks to your kindness) I had a week&rsquo;s
holiday with some friends of mine who live in the town of Pendlebury.&nbsp;
One of those friends (the only one now left in the place) kept a chemist&rsquo;s
shop, and in that shop I was made acquainted with one of the two doctors
in the town, named Barsham.&nbsp; This Barsham was a first-rate surgeon,
and might have got to the top of his profession, if he had not been
a first-rate blackguard.&nbsp; As it was, he both drank and gambled;
nobody would have anything to do with him in Pendlebury; and, at the
time when I was made known to him in the chemist&rsquo;s shop, the other
doctor, Mr. Dix, who was not to be compared with him for surgical skill,
but who was a respectable man, had got all the practice; and Barsham
and his old mother were living together in such a condition of utter
poverty, that it was a marvel to everybody how they kept out of the
parish workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benjamin and Benjamin&rsquo;s mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Last Thursday morning (thanks
to your kindness, again) I went to Pendlebury to my friend the chemist,
to ask a few questions about Barsham and his mother.&nbsp; I was told
that they had both left the town about five years since.&nbsp; When
I inquired into the circumstances, some strange particulars came out
in the course of the chemist&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp; You know I have no
doubt, ma&rsquo;am, that poor Mrs. Kirkland was confined while her husband
was at sea, in lodgings at a village called Flatfield, and that she
died and was buried there.&nbsp; But what you may not know is, that
Flatfield is only three miles from Pendlebury; that the doctor who attended
on Mrs. Kirkland was Barsham; that the nurse who took care of her was
Barsham&rsquo;s mother; and that the person who called them both in,
was Mr. Forley.&nbsp; Whether his daughter wrote to him, or whether
he heard of it in some other way, I don&rsquo;t know; but he was with
her (though he had sworn never to see her again when she married) a
month or more before her confinement, and was backwards and forwards
a good deal between Flatfield and Pendlebury.&nbsp; How he managed matters
with the Barshams cannot at present be discovered; but it is a fact
that he contrived to keep the drunken doctor sober, to everybody&rsquo;s
amazement.&nbsp; It is a fact that Barsham went to the poor woman with
all his wits about him.&nbsp; It is a fact that he and his mother came
back from Flatfield after Mrs. Kirkland&rsquo;s death, packed up what
few things they had, and left the town mysteriously by night.&nbsp;
And, lastly, it is also a fact that the other doctor, Mr. Dix, was not
called in to help, till a week after the birth <i>and burial</i> of
the child, when the mother was sinking from exhaustion&mdash;exhaustion
(to give the vagabond, Barsham, his due) not produced, in Mr. Dix&rsquo;s
opinion, by improper medical treatment, but by the bodily weakness of
the poor woman herself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burial of the child?&rdquo; I interrupted, trembling all over.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Trottle! you spoke that word &lsquo;burial&rsquo; in a very strange
way&mdash;you are fixing your eyes on me now with a very strange look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trottle leaned over close to me, and pointed through the window to
the empty house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child&rsquo;s death is registered, at Pendlebury,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;on Barsham&rsquo;s certificate, under the head of Male
Infant, Still-Born.&nbsp; The child&rsquo;s coffin lies in the mother&rsquo;s
grave, in Flatfield churchyard.&nbsp; The child himself&mdash;as surely
as I live and breathe, is living and breathing now&mdash;a castaway
and a prisoner in that villainous house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sank back in my chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s guess-work, so far, but it is borne in on my mind,
for all that, as truth.&nbsp; Rouse yourself, ma&rsquo;am, and think
a little.&nbsp; The last I hear of Barsham, he is attending Mr. Forley&rsquo;s
disobedient daughter.&nbsp; The next I see of Barsham, he is in Mr.
Forley&rsquo;s house, trusted with a secret.&nbsp; He and his mother
leave Pendlebury suddenly and suspiciously five years back; and he and
his mother have got a child of five years old, hidden away in the house.&nbsp;
Wait! please to wait&mdash;I have not done yet.&nbsp; The will left
by Mr. Forley&rsquo;s father, strengthens the suspicion.&nbsp; The friend
I took with me to Doctors&rsquo; Commons, made himself master of the
contents of that will; and when he had done so, I put these two questions
to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can Mr. Forley leave his money at his own discretion
to anybody he pleases?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; my friend says,
&lsquo;his father has left him with only a life interest in it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Suppose one of Mr. Forley&rsquo;s married daughters has a girl,
and the other a boy, how would the money go?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It
would all go,&rsquo; my friend says, &lsquo;to the boy, and it would
be charged with the payment of a certain annual income to his female
cousin.&nbsp; After her death, it would go back to the male descendant,
and to his heirs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Consider that, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; The
child of the daughter whom Mr. Forley hates, whose husband has been
snatched away from his vengeance by death, takes his whole property
in defiance of him; and the child of the daughter whom he loves, is
left a pensioner on her low-born boy-cousin for life!&nbsp; There was
good&mdash;too good reason&mdash;why that child of Mrs. Kirkland&rsquo;s
should be registered stillborn.&nbsp; And if, as I believe, the register
is founded on a false certificate, there is better, still better reason,
why the existence of the child should be hidden, and all trace of his
parentage blotted out, in the garret of that empty house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and pointed for the second time to the dim, dust-covered
garret-windows opposite.&nbsp; As he did so, I was startled&mdash;a
very slight matter sufficed to frighten me now&mdash;by a knock at the
door of the room in which we were sitting.</p>
<p>My maid came in, with a letter in her hand.&nbsp; I took it from
her.&nbsp; The mourning card, which was all the envelope enclosed, dropped
from my hands.</p>
<p>George Forley was no more.&nbsp; He had departed this life three
days since, on the evening of Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did our last chance of discovering the truth,&rdquo; I asked,
&ldquo;rest with <i>him</i>?&nbsp; Has it died with <i>his</i> death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; Our chance
rests on our power to make Barsham and his mother confess; and Mr. Forley&rsquo;s
death, by leaving them helpless, seems to put that power into our hands.&nbsp;
With your permission, I will not wait till dusk to-day, as I at first
intended, but will make sure of those two people at once.&nbsp; With
a policeman in plain clothes to watch the house, in case they try to
leave it; with this card to vouch for the fact of Mr. Forley&rsquo;s
death; and with a bold acknowledgment on my part of having got possession
of their secret, and of being ready to use it against them in case of
need, I think there is little doubt of bringing Barsham and his mother
to terms.&nbsp; In case I find it impossible to get back here before
dusk, please to sit near the window, ma&rsquo;am, and watch the house,
a little before they light the street-lamps.&nbsp; If you see the front-door
open and close again, will you be good enough to put on your bonnet,
and come across to me immediately?&nbsp; Mr. Forley&rsquo;s death may,
or may not, prevent his messenger from coming as arranged.&nbsp; But,
if the person does come, it is of importance that you, as a relative
of Mr. Forley&rsquo;s should be present to see him, and to have that
proper influence over him which I cannot pretend to exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only words I could say to Trottle as he opened the door and left
me, were words charging him to take care that no harm happened to the
poor forlorn little boy.</p>
<p>Left alone, I drew my chair to the window; and looked out with a
beating heart at the guilty house.&nbsp; I waited and waited through
what appeared to me to be an endless time, until I heard the wheels
of a cab stop at the end of the street.&nbsp; I looked in that direction,
and saw Trottle get out of the cab alone, walk up to the house, and
knock at the door.&nbsp; He was let in by Barsham&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;
A minute or two later, a decently-dressed man sauntered past the house,
looked up at it for a moment, and sauntered on to the corner of the
street close by.&nbsp; Here he leant against the post, and lighted a
cigar, and stopped there smoking in an idle way, but keeping his face
always turned in the direction of the house-door.</p>
<p>I waited and waited still.&nbsp; I waited and waited, with my eyes
riveted to the door of the house.&nbsp; At last I thought I saw it open
in the dusk, and then felt sure I heard it shut again softly.&nbsp;
Though I tried hard to compose myself, I trembled so that I was obliged
to call for Peggy to help me on with my bonnet and cloak, and was forced
to take her arm to lean on, in crossing the street.</p>
<p>Trottle opened the door to us, before we could knock.&nbsp; Peggy
went back, and I went in.&nbsp; He had a lighted candle in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has happened, ma&rsquo;am, as I thought it would,&rdquo;
he whispered, leading me into the bare, comfortless, empty parlour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Barsham and his mother have consulted their own interests, and
have come to terms.&nbsp; My guess-work is guess-work no longer.&nbsp;
It is now what I felt it was&mdash;Truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something strange to me&mdash;something which women who are mothers
must often know&mdash;trembled suddenly in my heart, and brought the
warm tears of my youthful days thronging back into my eyes.&nbsp; I
took my faithful old servant by the hand, and asked him to let me see
Mrs. Kirkland&rsquo;s child, for his mother&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you desire it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Trottle, with a
gentleness of manner that I had never noticed in him before.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
pray don&rsquo;t think me wanting in duty and right feeling, if I beg
you to try and wait a little.&nbsp; You are agitated already, and a
first meeting with the child will not help to make you so calm, as you
would wish to be, if Mr. Forley&rsquo;s messenger comes.&nbsp; The little
boy is safe up-stairs.&nbsp; Pray think first of trying to compose yourself
for a meeting with a stranger; and believe me you shall not leave the
house afterwards without the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that Trottle was right, and sat down as patiently as I could
in a chair he had thoughtfully placed ready for me.&nbsp; I was so horrified
at the discovery of my own relation&rsquo;s wickedness that when Trottle
proposed to make me acquainted with the confession wrung from Barsham
and his mother, I begged him to spare me all details, and only to tell
me what was necessary about George Forley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that can be said for Mr. Forley, ma&rsquo;am, is, that
he was just scrupulous enough to hide the child&rsquo;s existence and
blot out its parentage here, instead of consenting, at the first, to
its death, or afterwards, when the boy grew up, to turning him adrift,
absolutely helpless in the world.&nbsp; The fraud has been managed,
ma&rsquo;am, with the cunning of Satan himself.&nbsp; Mr. Forley had
the hold over the Barshams, that they had helped him in his villany,
and that they were dependent on him for the bread they eat.&nbsp; He
brought them up to London to keep them securely under his own eye.&nbsp;
He put them into this empty house (taking it out of the agent&rsquo;s
hands previously, on pretence that he meant to manage the letting of
it himself); and by keeping the house empty, made it the surest of all
hiding places for the child.&nbsp; Here, Mr. Forley could come, whenever
he pleased, to see that the poor lonely child was not absolutely starved;
sure that his visits would only appear like looking after his own property.&nbsp;
Here the child was to have been trained to believe himself Barsham&rsquo;s
child, till he should be old enough to be provided for in some situation,
as low and as poor as Mr. Forley&rsquo;s uneasy conscience would let
him pick out.&nbsp; He may have thought of atonement on his death-bed;
but not before&mdash;I am only too certain of it&mdash;not before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low, double knock startled us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The messenger!&rdquo; said Trottle, under his breath.&nbsp;
He went out instantly to answer the knock; and returned, leading in
a respectable-looking elderly man, dressed like Trottle, all in black,
with a white cravat, but otherwise not at all resembling him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have made some mistake,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>
<p>Trottle, considerately taking the office of explanation into his
own hands, assured the gentleman that there was no mistake; mentioned
to him who I was; and asked him if he had not come on business connected
with the late Mr. Forley.&nbsp; Looking greatly astonished, the gentleman
answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an awkward moment of silence,
after that.&nbsp; The stranger seemed to be not only startled and amazed,
but rather distrustful and fearful of committing himself as well.&nbsp;
Noticing this, I thought it best to request Trottle to put an end to
further embarrassment, by stating all particulars truthfully, as he
had stated them to me; and I begged the gentleman to listen patiently
for the late Mr. Forley&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He bowed to me very respectfully,
and said he was prepared to listen with the greatest interest.</p>
<p>It was evident to me&mdash;and, I could see, to Trottle also&mdash;that
we were not dealing, to say the least, with a dishonest man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I offer any opinion on what I have heard,&rdquo; he
said, earnestly and anxiously, after Trottle had done, &ldquo;I must
be allowed, in justice to myself, to explain my own apparent connection
with this very strange and very shocking business.&nbsp; I was the confidential
legal adviser of the late Mr. Forley, and I am left his executor.&nbsp;
Rather more than a fortnight back, when Mr. Forley was confined to his
room by illness, he sent for me, and charged me to call and pay a certain
sum of money here, to a man and woman whom I should find taking charge
of the house.&nbsp; He said he had reasons for wishing the affair to
be kept a secret.&nbsp; He begged me so to arrange my engagements that
I could call at this place either on Monday last, or to-day, at dusk;
and he mentioned that he would write to warn the people of my coming,
without mentioning my name (Dalcott is my name), as he did not wish
to expose me to any future importunities on the part of the man and
woman.&nbsp; I need hardly tell you that this commission struck me as
being a strange one; but, in my position with Mr. Forley, I had no resource
but to accept it without asking questions, or to break off my long and
friendly connection with my client.&nbsp; I chose the first alternative.&nbsp;
Business prevented me from doing my errand on Monday last&mdash;and
if I am here to-day, notwithstanding Mr. Forley&rsquo;s unexpected death,
it is emphatically because I understood nothing of the matter, on knocking
at this door; and therefore felt myself bound, as executor, to clear
it up.&nbsp; That, on my word of honour, is the whole truth, so far
as I am personally concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel quite sure of it, sir,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mentioned Mr. Forley&rsquo;s death, just now, as unexpected.&nbsp;
May I inquire if you were present, and if he has left any last instructions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hours before Mr. Forley&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dalcott, &ldquo;his medical attendant left him apparently in a fair
way of recovery.&nbsp; The change for the worse took place so suddenly,
and was accompanied by such severe suffering, to prevent him from communicating
his last wishes to any one.&nbsp; When I reached his house, he was insensible.&nbsp;
I have since examined his papers.&nbsp; Not one of them refers to the
present time or to the serious matter which now occupies us.&nbsp; In
the absence of instructions I must act cautiously on what you have told
me; but I will be rigidly fair and just at the same time.&nbsp; The
first thing to be done,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself to Trottle,
&ldquo;is to hear what the man and woman, down-stairs, have to say.&nbsp;
If you can supply me with writing-materials, I will take their declarations
separately on the spot, in your presence, and in the presence of the
policeman who is watching the house.&nbsp; To-morrow I will send copies
of those declarations, accompanied by a full statement of the case,
to Mr. and Mrs. Bayne in Canada (both of whom know me well as the late
Mr. Forley&rsquo;s legal adviser); and I will suspend all proceedings,
on my part, until I hear from them, or from their solicitor in London.&nbsp;
In the present posture of affairs this is all I can safely do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We could do no less than agree with him, and thank him for his frank
and honest manner of meeting us.&nbsp; It was arranged that I should
send over the writing-materials from my lodgings; and, to my unutterable
joy and relief, it was also readily acknowledged that the poor little
orphan boy could find no fitter refuge than my old arms were longing
to offer him, and no safer protection for the night than my roof could
give.&nbsp; Trottle hastened away up-stairs, as actively as if he had
been a young man, to fetch the child down.</p>
<p>And he brought him down to me without another moment of delay, and
I went on my knees before the poor little Mite, and embraced him, and
asked him if he would go with me to where I lived?&nbsp; He held me
away for a moment, and his wan, shrewd little eyes looked sharp at me.&nbsp;
Then he clung close to me all at once, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-going along with you, I am&mdash;and so I tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For inspiring the poor neglected child with this trust in my old
self, I thanked Heaven, then, with all my heart and soul, and I thank
it now!</p>
<p>I bundled the poor darling up in my own cloak, and I carried him
in my own arms across the road.&nbsp; Peggy was lost in speechless amazement
to behold me trudging out of breath up-stairs, with a strange pair of
poor little legs under my arm; but, she began to cry over the child
the moment she saw him, like a sensible woman as she always was, and
she still cried her eyes out over him in a comfortable manner, when
he at last lay fast asleep, tucked up by my hands in Trottle&rsquo;s
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Trottle, bless you, my dear man,&rdquo; said I, kissing
his hand, as he looked on: &ldquo;the forlorn baby came to this refuge
through you, and he will help you on your way to Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trottle answered that I was his dear mistress, and immediately went
and put his head out at an open window on the landing, and looked into
the back street for a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>That very night, as I sat thinking of the poor child, and of another
poor child who is never to be thought about enough at Christmas-time,
the idea came into my mind which I have lived to execute, and in the
realisation of which I am the happiest of women this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The executor will sell that House, Trottle?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a doubt of it, ma&rsquo;am, if he can find a purchaser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have often seen Trottle pleased; but, I never saw him so perfectly
enchanted as he was when I confided to him, which I did, then and there,
the purpose that I had in view.</p>
<p>To make short of a long story&mdash;and what story would not be long,
coming from the lips of an old woman like me, unless it was made short
by main force!&mdash;I bought the House.&nbsp; Mrs. Bayne had her father&rsquo;s
blood in her; she evaded the opportunity of forgiving and generous reparation
that was offered her, and disowned the child; but, I was prepared for
that, and loved him all the more for having no one in the world to look
to, but me.</p>
<p>I am getting into a flurry by being over-pleased, and I dare say
I am as incoherent as need be.&nbsp; I bought the House, and I altered
it from the basement to the roof, and I turned it into a Hospital for
Sick Children.</p>
<p>Never mind by what degrees my little adopted boy came to the knowledge
of all the sights and sounds in the streets, so familiar to other children
and so strange to him; never mind by what degrees he came to be pretty,
and childish, and winning, and companionable, and to have pictures and
toys about him, and suitable playmates.&nbsp; As I write, I look across
the road to my Hospital, and there is the darling (who has gone over
to play) nodding at me out of one of the once lonely windows, with his
dear chubby face backed up by Trottle&rsquo;s waistcoat as he lifts
my pet for &ldquo;Grandma&rdquo; to see.</p>
<p>Many an Eye I see in that House now, but it is never in solitude,
never in neglect.&nbsp; Many an Eye I see in that House now, that is
more and more radiant every day with the light of returning health.&nbsp;
As my precious darling has changed beyond description for the brighter
and the better, so do the not less precious darlings of poor women change
in that House every day in the year.&nbsp; For which I humbly thank
that Gracious Being whom the restorer of the Widow&rsquo;s son and of
the Ruler&rsquo;s daughter, instructed all mankind to call their Father.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
